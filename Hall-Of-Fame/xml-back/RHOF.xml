   <citation>Staff Sergeant Laszlo Rabel is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for conspicuous gallantry and indomitable courage as a Ranger leader. On November 13, 1968, Sergeant Rabel was leader of Team Delta, 74th Infantry Detachment Long Range Patrol. While in a patrol base on hill 819 in the Binh Dinh Province, Republic of South Vietnam, Sergeant Rabel's Team was suddenly compromised. While preparing for a counter-reconnaissance mission, a hand grenade was thrown into the perimeter. In a final act of courage, and without hesitation, Sergeant Rabel threw himself on the grenade, absorbing the full blast, thus saving his team from death or injury. Sergeant Rabel's gallant actions and disregard for his own safety earned him the Medal of Honor, posthumously. Sergeant Rabel paid the ultimate sacrifice to his nation and clearly illustrates that no matter how severe the consequences a Ranger never fails his comrades.</citation>

   <citation>Staff Sergeant Robert J. Pruden is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary courage and gallantry in action as a Ranger qualified leader. Sergeant Pruden is the second U.S. Army Ranger assigned to a U.S. Ranger Company in ground combat to be awarded the Medal of Honor, and the only graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger School to be awarded the Medal of Honor while serving in a Ranger Unit. On November 22, 1969, while serving as a Team Leader for Company G. (Ranger) 75th Infantry, Sergeant Pruden was establishing an ambush site when a security team member saw an enemy squad moving through the area. A second enemy force arrived as the first one opened fire on an alienated security team member attempting to rejoin the team. Unable to move without being shot, the security team member continued firing at the enemy. His ambush site compromised, Pruden directed his team's fires, trying to free the trapped Ranger. Sergeant Pruden saw the situation as hopeless when the second enemy force opened fire. Leaving the safety of his position, Pruden ran past his trapped team member, charged directly into the enemy, and fired his weapon to draw fire away from his trapped teammate. Pruden attacked the enemy until he was wounded three times. His efforts caused several enemy casualties, forcing them to withdraw. Sergeant Pruden's gallant actions clearly show that, "Surrender is not a Ranger word."</citation>

Specialist Law is the first U.S. Army Ranger to be awarded the Medal of Honor while assigned to a U.S. Army Ranger unit. On February 22, 1969, while on a long-range reconnaissance patrol from Company I, (Ranger) 75th Infantry at Thinh Phuoc Thanh Province Vietnam, Specialist Law and his team engaged the enemy in a firefight. Attempting to disengage from the Ranger Team, the enemy threw gas grenades. Noting the Team's ammunition supply was low, Specialist Law rose to flank the enemy and exposed himself to enemy fire. He placed effective suppressive fires on the enemy, which forced them to throw a hand grenade to break contact with the Rangers. Instead of diving rearward to save his own life, Specialist Law threw himself on the grenade, absorbing the full blast, thus saving his teammates. Specialist Law's heroic actions illustrate the many sacrifices Rangers have made for their country, their unit, and their fellow Rangers.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Martin R. Watson is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary valor and unyielding determination as a United States Army Ranger. Sergeant Watson served with the 1st Ranger Battalion in World War II and fought in the Northern Africa, Sicily and Central Europe campaigns. He was captured by the Germans at Cassino, Italy and remained a prisoner of war for fifteen months. Sergeant Watson attempted escape on one occasion but was recaptured. He was repatriated following World War II and volunteered for the 4th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) during the Korean War. Sergeant Watson and three other Rangers were detected by the enemy while on a mission 65 miles behind Chinese lines. Following a foiled rescue attempt, Sergeant Watson, a downed U.S. Navy pilot, and nineteen South Korean agents evaded capture by the North Koreans for ten days with no food or supplies. After his capture, the North Koreans repeatedly tortured Sergeant Watson for attempting escape on three separate occasions. Sergeant Watson was the last U.S. serviceman repatriated following the Korean War. He earned the Silver Star for valorous actions during the Korean War, and the Bronze Star for his resilience and refusal to cooperate with the enemy after repeated torture. Sergeant Watson's iron will and unshakable resolve are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and clearly illustrate that surrender is not a Ranger word.</citation>

   <citation>Major Robert Rogers is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for outstanding service to Colonial America and the Colonial Army as a Ranger-type leader. Rogers commanded Rangers who served as part of the British Army on the North American frontier during the French and Indian War (1754-1763). He and his Rangers terrorized the French and their Indian allies. While the British, and most American troops, adhered to their fortifications throughout the year, Rogers' Rangers quietly avoided French and Indian scouts and ambushed their columns and supply lines during every season. His great effectiveness prompted the British Army to form light infantry regiments intended to operate like Rangers. Rogers published his Ranger tactics for use of light infantry officers, and many of his "Standing Orders" are applicable today. Rogers' tactics and success as a Ranger have set the standard for today's U.S. Army Rangers.</citation>

Upon reaching the crest of the hill, Corporal Hall volunteered to contact the friendly unit on an adjacent hill. He moved out under intense mortar and small arms fire only to find the hill occupied by enemy troops. He killed a Chinese soldier in a foxhole and used the position to single handily drive the enemy from the hill, thus securing the flank of his platoon. Corporal Hall was wounded by an enemy grenade in the fierce fighting, but tenaciously held his ground until he was joined by his comrades.

Suddenly realizing there was no beachhead, and already under intense enemy fire, Colonel Schneider swung the flotilla east. He bought his Rangers on the beach intact, ready to fight. The 5th Ranger Battalion stormed the beach under heavy enemy fire and successfully established a beachhead. This allowed U.S. forces to move further inland.

He led his unit on highly successful ambushes of Union Army combat units and on raids on Union supply lines. Mosby's Rangers were able to evade pursuit by elite Union cavalry regiments, and thus continued their effective reconnaissance, raid, and ambush missions until the end of the war. His rapport with the civilian population, discipline within his command, knowledge of Ranger tactics, and high dedication to the mission, even when wounded, contributed to his unit's success. Despite his tenacity in combat against Union forces, Mosby gave valuable postwar service as a U.S. government employee.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel George A. McGee is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary valor and exemplary service as commander of the 2d Battalion, 5307th Composite Unit, known as Merrill's Marauders. In August 1943 the War Department selected Colonel McGee to command a battalion-size unit formed from volunteers from the 33rd Infantry Regiment, which was redesignated as 2d Battalion, 5307th Composite Unit. Colonel McGee served as battalion commander from the formation of Merrill's Marauders until their last mission at Myitkyina in June 1944. Colonel McGee led his battalion in missions behind enemy lines in the steaming jungles of Burma to sever Japanese communications and supply lines. Many of Colonel McGee's soldiers suffered from malaria, typhoid, malnutrition and other ailments, but fought gallantly against the Japanese in major battles at Walawbum, Nhpum Ga, Inkangawtaung, Shadazup, and Myitkyina, and were involved in over 30 minor engagements with the enemy. Though Colonel McGee served in many capacities during his twenty years of service in the Army, he considered his command of the 2d Battalion of Merrill's Marauders the highlight of his military career. Colonel McGee's dedication to duty and superb leadership continue to lead the way for Rangers past and present.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel Francis W. (Bull) Dawson is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary valor while serving as a platoon leader with Company D, 5th Ranger Battalion. Then First Lieutenant Dawson landed on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, and was pinned down on the beach along with the entire invasion force. When a gap was finally blown in a wire obstacle that was holding them on the beach, Lieutenant Dawson sprang up and dashed through heavy machine-gun fire and an uncleared minefield. He began a fierce attack on an enemy fortified position, personally destroying a machine-gun position that pinned down the Battalion, cleared trenches and bunkers, and captured several German troops. The efforts of Lieutenant Dawson and the 5th Ranger Battalion saved the beachhead and led to the battle cry of the Rangers today, "Rangers Lead the Way!" Colonel Dawson later volunteered for the Ranger Training Command in 1950, and was selected when experienced Rangers were needed for the creation of the Special Forces. Colonel Dawson was then chosen to command the 8112 Army Unit, which conducted special operations into North Korea during the Korean War. He also served during the Vietnam War as one of the early advisors to the South Vietnamese Special Forces. Colonel Dawson is a combat veteran of three wars who continually volunteered for elite units and dangerous assignments, and truly "Led the Way!".</citation>

   <citation>Benjamin Church is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for outstanding service to Colonial America and to the New England Armed Forces as a Ranger-type leader. Church commanded an independent Ranger company during King Philip's War (1675-1678) on the New England frontier where they conducted highly successful combat operations against hostile Indians. Church's men were the first Rangers successful in raiding the Indians' hiding places in forests and swamps. During previous decades, American Rangers were on the defense against the Indians. Church's rapport with Indians was a major factor in his success. He persuaded many hostile Indians to surrender and join his unit where they operated skillfully as Rangers. During the summer of 1676, Church patrolled the Plymouth countryside and made contact with hostile Indians. The Rangers followed them into the forests and swamps and conducted effective raids and ambushes on their camps. The war soon ended after a company operation on August 12, 1676, when one of Church's Indian Rangers killed Philip, a key leader of hostile Indians. Over the next 28 years, Church led five New England raiding parties into Maine and Canada against the French and Indians. Church kept notes on his tactics and operations, which were eventually published in 1716. His tactics and methods are used by Rangers to this day.</citation>

SSG Dolby was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his gallant actions on May 21, 1966. While on patrol in the Republic of Vietnam, SSG Dolby's platoon came under intense enemy fire. Six members of the platoon were killed instantly and a number were wounded, including the platoon leader. Aware that the platoon was in a precarious situation, SSG Dolby moved the wounded men to safety and deployed the remainder of the platoon to engage the enemy. Under orders from his dying platoon leader to withdraw, SSG Dolby, with utter disregard for his own safety, positioned able-bodied men to cover the withdraw of the forward elements, assisted the wounded to the new position, and he alone, attacked the enemy positions until his ammunition was expended. Replenishing his ammunition, Dolby single-handedly killed 3 enemy machine gunners and neutralized the enemy fire. Ranger Dolby's actions of unsurpassed valor during 4 hours of intense combat were a source of inspiration to his entire company, and contributed to the overall success of the assault on the enemy position.</citation>

Author of "The Ranger Creed," he established a code of ethical conduct in which the Ranger of today sets his beliefs. CSM Gentry was responsible for establishing the cadre of noncommissioned officers that would build upon and set the standards and successful activation of the 1st Ranger Battalion. He was instrumental in the development of the Coat of Arms and Distinguished Unit Insignia (DUI) for the Regiment. The DUI is still worn as an accouterment on the Ranger Dress uniform and black beret. The standards established by Command Sergeant Major Gentry were demonstrated in every combat operation that Rangers have participated in since activation in 1974.

During the late summer of 1776 Captain Hale was selected to command a company in Thomas Knowlton's Battalion of Connecticut Rangers. A short while later, General George Washington asked for a Ranger officer to gather intelligence behind British Army lines in New York. Hale quickly volunteered despite a friend's attempt to discourage him. He penetrated British lines, disguised as a schoolmaster. After gathering information on the dispositions of British regiments for about a week, he was compromised and arrested. He proudly admitted that he was an American soldier and that he was spying on his captors. The British commander ordered him to be executed, without trial. The next day, September 22, 1776, as he was being readied for hanging, he declared to his British captors, "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country". He was buried in an unmarked, Manhattan, New York grave. He knew that his special mission was extremely dangerous, but he did not hesitate to serve his country with his very life. During the last two hundred years Captain Hale's dying words have become the classic expression of American patriotism.</citation>

Early in 1832 he was elected captain of a company of the 4th Illinois Regiment, which served during part of the Black Hawk War (1832). When his company was discharged, Lincoln volunteered as a private in a company of the Illinois frontier guard, whose soldiers were known as Rangers, scouts, and spies. For two and one-half weeks during the late spring of 1832 he patrolled the northwestern frontier of Illinois with his company, on the lookout for Indian war parties. When the company's Rangers were discharged, Lincoln immediately reenlisted in another company of the frontier guard. He and the company served a three week tour of duty during the early summer by scouting in advance of the army as it moved northward into Wisconsin. After his military service Lincoln became a prominent Illinois attorney, a popular political leader, and President of the United States. His strong, successful leadership as the Union's President during the War Between the States (1861-65) made him a great American folk hero. He is often considered the best example of the greatness that can be produced by a democracy.</citation>

Sergeant First Class Littrell single handily bolstered the besieged battalion, directed artillery and air support by day and marked the units position by night, despite the heavy concentrated enemy fire. Assault after assault was repulsed as the battalion responded to the extraordinary leadership and personal example exhibited by SFC Littrell. He continuously moved to those points most seriously threatened by the enemy, redistributed ammunition, strengthened faltering defenses, cared for the wounded and shouted encouragement to the Vietnamese in their own language. When finally ordered to withdraw, numerous ambushes were encountered. SFC Littrell repeatedly prevented widespread disorder, by directing airstrikes within 50 meters of their own position.

Private Mastin trained as a Ranger with the first 9th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) at Fort Benning during the period February through April 1951. Due to numerous casualties in the six Airborne Ranger companies then in Korea, the first 9th Company was disbanded and many of its members were sent to Korea as Ranger replacements. Private Mastin joined the 1st Airborne Ranger Company just before an extremely heavy action known as the "May Massacre" in which 1st Company was almost annihilated. In this major action near Kunmul-Gol, Korea, May 17-18, 1951, Private Mastin had been assigned as a platoon aidman. The company, committed to secure commanding ground on the left flank of a 2nd Division battalion, had moved into position under withering automatic weapons and small arms fire. Private Mastin constantly braved intense hostile fire as he ministered to the wounded and assisted in their evacuation. Although wounded himself in the initial action, he continued to perform his duties with determination. The enemy launched repeated assaults, showering friendly positions with grenades, inflicting further casualties. Disregarding his own personal safety, Private Mastin moved freely among the wounded, continued to render aid, and assisted his fellow Rangers to places of safety. Despite additional wounds received during the continuing action, he unhesitatingly made his way to the assistance of a wounded comrade through heavy enemy fire. While continuing his heroic performance of duty and directing others in caring for the wounded, he lost his life. Private Mastin was recommended for the Congressional Medal of Honor and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross posthumously.

Master Sergeant Matsumoto accomplished many dangerous missions by infiltrating Japanese lines every night to listen and snipe. During the siege at Nhpum Ga on an intelligence gathering mission, he returned one night with news of an impending attack. The Marauders met the enemy with devastating fire. When the attack failed, Matsumoto stood and yelled in Japanese for the attack to continue. The next wave met the same fate as the first. The siege was finally lifted after ten days by an attack of the remaining Marauders. The Marauders continued to march and capture the all weather airstrip at Myitkyina where Matsumoto was in the last group of 17 men to be evacuated after the mission.

   <citation>Sergeant Donn F. Porter is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary courage and gallantry in action as a Ranger qualified leader. Sergeant Porter was the only Airborne Ranger to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor during the Korean War. He trained with the second 9th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) from May through September 1951 and was awarded the Ranger Tab on graduation. When the Airborne Ranger companies were disbanded as cease fire negotiations started in Korea, Sergeant Porter and 24 other 9th Company Rangers volunteered for duty in Korea and were assigned to the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (ARCT). At that time, the 187th was in strategic reserve on Kyushu Island, in southern Japan, so Sergeant Porter volunteered for combat duty on line in Korea and was assigned to Company G, 14th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. He was soon promoted to Sergeant and placed in charge of a combat outpost in the vicinity of Mundung-ni and "Heartbreak Ridge" at a key approach into the main line. An enemy force estimated at 400 men probed the position with artillery and mortar for several hours. In the first main assault, Sergeant Porter's group of four men expended 4-6 cases of grenades that were on position, killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded many more. Two of Porter's men were killed. In the second assault, Sergeant Porter jumped from his position with bayonet fixed and meeting the onslaught in close combat, killed six hostile soldiers and routed the attack. When his body was found, he still clutched his rifle with the fixed bayonet rammed into the body of a North Korean soldier. His supreme sacrifice has set the example for all who wear the Ranger Tab on into the future. The Porter Range at Fort Benning has been named in his honor.</citation>

On April 1, 1970 Sergeant Lemon distinguished himself while serving as an assistant machine gunner during the defense of Fire Support Base Illingworth in Tay Ninh Province, Republic of Vietnam. Sergeant Lemon engaged a numerically superior enemy with machine gun and rifle fire from his defensive position until both weapons malfunctioned. He then used hand grenades to fend off the intensive enemy attack launched in his direction. After eliminating all but one of the enemy soldiers in the immediate vicinity, he pursued and disposed of the remaining soldier in hand-to-hand combat. Despite fragment wounds from an exploding grenade, Sergeant Lemon regained his position, carried a more seriously wounded comrade to an aid station, and as he returned, was wounded again by enemy fire. Disregarding his personal injuries, he moved to his position through a hale of small arms and grenade fire. Sergeant Lemon immediately realized that the defensive sector was in danger of being overrun by the enemy and unhesitatingly assaulted the enemy soldiers by throwing hand grenades and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Fully exposing himself to enemy fire Sergeant Lemon engaged the enemy until he collapsed from his wounds. After regaining consciousness he refused medical evacuation until those more seriously wounded had been evacuated. Sergeant Lemon's actions epitomized the Ranger Creed.

Sighting another fortification, he crawled through the fierce enemy fire and silenced it with his rifle. After eliminating the hostile entrenchment system, he continued his patrol mission. On the 1 0th of April his patrol was attacked a second time. From his patrol position in a bomb crater, he called in artillery and air support on the large enemy element. When withdrawing his troops to a nearby landing zone for evacuation, he came under sniper fire from two North Vietnamese soldiers, whom he quickly eliminated with a well thrown grenade. Intense enemy fire thwarted the extraction aircraft's first landing attempt. He then directed a gun ship on the enemy location and effected a successful extraction.

Surrounded by the Germans, he, together with SSG Jack E. Kuhn, found the five big mobile coastal guns of Pointe du Hoc that were missing from the Pointe. They were hidden in an apple orchard over a mile inland from the Points. The guns were momentarily unguarded. First Sergeant Lomell alone seized the opportunity to slip into the position and silently, with the use of thermite incendiary grenades melted together the moving parts of the traversing and elevation mechanisms and the breech blocks of the guns, thus rendering them inoperable by 08:30 a.m. D-Day. Many thousands of lives of soldiers on the landing beaches of Normandy were spared by First Sergeant Lomell's bold, brave, and outstanding leadership in the face of such superior numbers.

Staff Sergeant Pung distinguished himself in action at Walawbum, Burma. As a member of the Orange Combat Team his battalion swept around the Japanese right flank in a pincers movement that overran the enemy position. This maneuver killed over 800 enemy soldiers who were attempting to escape from the trap. Staff Sergeant Pung then climbed a tree and perched 50 feet off the ground. He kept his unit posted on the Japanese activity via a walkie-talkie radio. Upon seeing the Japanese advance he alerted his unit, then waited until the enemy was 50 yards away before giving the order to open fire. The Japanese soldiers running into a solid sheet of gunfire, broke and ran leaving another 200 dead behind. During this battle Staff Sergeant Pung's canteen was shot off his hip and his radio knocked out of his hand by a bursting artillery shell.

On December 11, 1941, the day the United States declared war on Germany, Senator Thurmond took a leave of absence from the Judicial Bench to join the United States Army. Having been in the Reserves since 1924, he was commissioned a Lieutenant with the First Army's Eighty-second Airborne Division. On D-Day in 1944, his troop glider crash-landed behind enemy lines in France. Sustaining minor injuries, he and the other men fought for two days in isolation before they succeeded in linking up with American Forces advancing from their beachhead in Normandy. This type of mission demonstrates a classic Ranger-style operation which included infiltration of an enemy held area, and disruption of enemy lines of communication and his order of battle. Senator Thurmond later served in the Pacific. By the time he was discharged, he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He retired from the United States Army Reserve as a Major General in 1960. In his later public service, Senator Thurmond advocated a strong National Defense including the full participation of the United States Army Reserve. He strongly supported the establishment and maintenance of an extraordinary fighting force, one that is capable of operating in all types of terrain, weather conditions, and without regard for the potential enemy hampering of the operational considerations.

In 1942 General George C. Marshal assigned General Truscott to Admiral Louis Mountbatten's Combined Operations Headquarters in London and gave him the responsibility of organizing an American counterpart to the British Commandos. Truscott visited every Commando unit training in England and Scotland and, as a result, created an American Ranger Unit, the first of its kind sense the days of the American Revolution. He derived the name from Rogers, Rangers who fought in the French and Indian War. Truscott recommended William O. Darby for the command of the new unit. General Truscott accompanied the Rangers on the Dieppe Raid and to North Africa. He received the Distinguished Service Medal in part for his organization of the new Ranger Unit. General Truscott's military service and dedication to the Rangers are of the highest degree. They reflect great honor upon himself, the Rangers and the United States Army.</citation>

   <citation>Anders K. Arnbal was drafted into the Army in 1941 and volunteered for service with the Rangers shortly thereafter because he was impressed with the small unit tactics of the British Commandos and longed for similar training and a challenging environment. He trained at Carrickfergus as a member of Darby's original Rangers and was assigned to Company B, 1st Ranger Battalion. He participated in the Torch Landings at Arzen, Algeria as a machine gun corporal and fought valiantly in Tunisia and at El Guettar. Later, he was part of the original cadre of 3d Ranger Battalion and was assigned as a platoon sergeant in Company D. Ranger Arnbal made the landings in Sicily and Italy and was later promoted to 1SG of Company D. Within hours of LD time for the Cisterna attack, he and three other members of 3d Ranger Battalion-all original Rangers, received orders for return to the United States. Both Colonel Darby and Major Miller, then commander of 3d Ranger Battalion, gave Ranger Arnbal and his three comrades orders not to participate in the attack as planned. Thus, he remained on the beachhead the next morning when news of the disaster and casualties started coming in. Ranger Arnbal took charge of the rear detachment Rangers to evacuate, treat, and account for the survivors. He attempted to launch a relief effort, but was overruled. 1SG Arnbal spent two grueling years overseas, fighting ferociously during four invasion landings and six major campaigns all with the Rangers!</citation>

   <citation>The Second Ranger Battalion was divided on D-Day, SGT Clark was assigned to be in charge of the Aid Station and Company "medics" assigned to A &amp; B Companies. Upon landing at Omaha Dog Green Beach, both companies suffered heavy losses; SGT Clark, without hesitation, calmly, and with great presence of mind treated the wounded, one with an open pneumothorax (sucking chest wound), wherever they had fallen Most of the other medics already were either WIA or KIA. Later, while he was B Company's aid man, the Company, ordered to protect the left flank of the 4th DIV, moved into an enemy mine field, at night, directly in front of three enemy strong points. Three mines were detonated, killing two and wounding six, two seriously. Immediately, he moved in, groping in the darkness to tend to the wounded and, eventually, remained all night with the seriously wounded in order to care for, and guard, them. Bill Clark displayed such courage and devotion to his duty and to fellow Rangers repeatedly during all the engagements of the Battalion. Upon his return home Bill Clark became a police officer in Washington, D.C. After serving on both the vice and auto squads for some years he retired as Detective Sergeant. He died 16 February 1992 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The awards of the Silver Star, Purple Heart, with cluster, and Bronze Star, with cluster attest to the actions of William C. Clark, dr. and his exemplification of a Ranger Medic.</citation>

   <citation>Major Gerald M. Deviin is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his contribution to the United States Army as a senior advisor to the South Vietnamese Biet Dong Quan, or Rangers. Deviin accompanied the 44th Vietnamese Ranger Battalion on numerous combat missions in the Mekong Delta. By late 1965 the 44th was one of the most successful South Vietnamese fighting units, due in large part to Deviin's leadership by example, his tactical advice, and his fire support coordination skills. He was awarded the Bronze Star for valor, the Purple Heart, the Distinguished Service Cross, and multiple awards of the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, earned during combat assaults with the 44th. During his last action as a Ranger advisor the 44th was counterattacked at night by a brigade strength Viet Cong unit. The battalion commander was killed and Deviin was severely wounded. When the 44th began to give way Deviin took command. Unable to walk and working in darkness with Rangers who understood only the Vietnamese language, he used a radio and crawled from position to position directing fire, adjusting fighting positions, directing aviation fire support, securing helicopter evacuation for wounded Rangers, and assuring the Rangers that they could hold. The 44th held and before dawn the Viet Cong withdrew. Deviin's example of Ranger leadership during his tour as a Ranger Advisor with the 44th Vietnamese Ranger Battalion reflects great credit on himself and all Rangers, past and present.</citation>

   <citation>Robert T. Edlin joined the Indiana National Guard in 1939 and was assigned to B Company, 152d Infantry, 38th Division. In April, 1941, he was promoted to Staff Sergeant and made a Platoon Leader, and his unit participated in the Louisiana Maneuvers. In 1942, he entered Officers Candidate School at Fort Benning, GA, where he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant in September of 1942, and assigned to Company K, 112th Infantry, 28th Infantry Division, at Camp Livingston, Louisiana. In May of 1943, he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and given further training at Camp Carrabelle, Florida, where he became an expert on the Browning Automatic Weapon (BAR), light machine gun, and the M-1 rifle. Later he was assigned as the Division Bayonet Instructor at Camp Pickett, Virginia. In November of 1943, Lieutenant Edlin was shipped to England with the 28th Infantry Division where he attended a British Commando and Battle School. In December of 1943, he volunteered for the Rangers and received Ranger Training at Braunton, England, and was assigned as a Platoon Leader, Company A, 2d Ranger Battalion at Bude, Cornewall, England. On June 6, 1944—D-Day, Lieutenant Edlin led his platoon across Omaha Beach and received two wounds in his leg, incapacitating him. The following day, he was evacuated to the 97th General Hospital, in England, where he remained until rejoining his platoon at St. Jean de Daye, France, on July 15, 1944. It was during the Brest Campaign on September 9, 1944, that Lieutenant Edlin led one of the most amazing assaults of the war by sneaking a small patrol into the most powerful fortress on the Brest Peninsula. At great personal risk, he forced a captured officer at gunpoint to lead him to the fortress commandant whom he threatened with a live grenade to surrender the fortress; this ultimately resulted in the capture of over 800 German soldiers and caused a cascading of surrenders throughout the area. For this action he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. In November of 1944, while leading a patrol in the Hurtgent Forest, a mine exploded wounding Lieutenant Edlin in the hand and face. Subsequently he was granted leave, and returned to the 2d Ranger Battalion and participated in the fighting across Germany. Lieutenant Edlin eventually returned home and married his High School sweetheart on December 7,1945. He was released from active duty in March of 1946. In 1948 Mr. Edlin joined the Indiana National Guard as a Captain of the 152d Infantry Regiment in Company K. He resigned his commission in 1954. His valiant service brings great credit upon himself and the United Stated Army.</citation>

   <citation>Master Sergeant Gary 1. Gordon is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in Mogadishu, Somalia, while attached to Task Force Ranger. On 3 October 1993, after providing protective fires during an assault, he and his team member were directed to the first helicopter crash site where they provided protective covering fires that allowed the Ranger Rescue Team to secure the area. When a second helicopter crashed, Master Sergeant Gordon unhesitatingly volunteered to be inserted to protect the critically wounded crew. When his third request to be inserted was granted, he and his fellow sniper fought their way through enemy fire and a dense maze of shanties and shacks to reach the critically injured crew. Master Sergeant Gordon pulled the pilot and other crew members to safety. He and his fellow sniper then secured the perimeter of the crash site, placing themselves in the most vulnerable positions. He then used his side arm and long range rifle to kill an undetermined number of attackers. Master Sergeant Gordon then went back into the wreckage and recovered some of the crew's weapons and ammunition. Despite the fact that he was critically low on ammunition, he provided some to the dazed pilot and continued to radio for help. With his team member now fatally wounded, Master Sergeant Gordon continued to travel the perimeter and provide protective fire. He gave his team member's rifle along with the last five rounds of ammunition to the downed pilot with the words "good luck". Then, armed only with his pistol, he continued to fight until he was fatally wounded. His actions saved the pilot's life. Master Sergeant Gordon's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the finest traditions of the Rangers, and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.</citation>

Among the first to volunteer for 1st Ranger BN, activated in Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland, 21 June 1942, he was assigned to F Company as a mortar squad sergeant. After surviving the grueling and realistic Commando Training at Achnacarry, Scotland, he took part in the N. African Invasion at Arzew and the Tunnisian Campaign where his performance earned him the rank of 1st Sergeant when the 4th Ranger BN was activated in May 1943. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and earned a battlefield commission for his extraordinary performance during the invasion of Sicily. His platoon was caught in a mine field that killed the company commander, wounded the remaining officers and also wounded Harris. There was a gash in his abdomen through which his intestines started to extrude; whereupon he pushed his innards back in place and covered the gaping hole with his web belt. Then he led the remnants of his company out of the mine field. Still in the battle, he attacked and silenced enemy pillboxes that threatened the landing area with machine gun fire. Later when the fight was over he refused medical help until his men, less wounded than he, were treated. He recovered from his injuries and returned to lead F Company through battles at Ceppagna and Venafro. He also participated in the Anzio landings where he led his company on the deepest inland penetration and successfully held off enemy counter attacks.</citation>

Lieutenant Junior Grade Kerrey led his SEALs on a mission to capture important members of the enemy's area political cadre known to be located on an island in the bay of Nha Trang. While leading his men in a treacherous downward descent under intense enemy fire, Lieutenant Kerrey received massive injuries from a grenade. Although bleeding profusely and suffering great pain, he displayed outstanding courage and presence of mind and immediately directed his element's fire into the heart of the enemy camp. After successfully suppressing the enemy's fire, and although immobilized by his multiple wounds, he continued to maintain calm, superlative control as he ordered his team to secure and defend an extraction site. Lieutenant Kerrey resolutely directed his men, despite his near-unconscious state, until he was eventually evacuated by helicopter. The havoc brought to the enemy by this very successful mission cannot be overestimated. The enemy soldiers who were captured provided critical intelligence to the allied effort. For this action he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Lieutenant Kerrey's courageous and inspiring leadership, valiant fighting spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in the face of almost overwhelming opposition sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the Rangers and truly set an example for all to follow.</citation>

While the Deputy Chief of Staff for operations for the Army, General Mahaffey was instrumental in the reactivation of the 3rd Ranger Battalion and the 75th Ranger Regiment. On 16 May 1989, the 3rd Infantry Division dedicated its Headquarters building in his honor. At that ceremony, he was remembered as a Commanding General who fostered the environment where all soldiers could develop their potential to the fullest, and as a soldier whose uncompromising loyalty and devotion to duty served the Army superbly for over a quarter of a century.

Turning down a commission in the medical field, he was sent to the Infantry Officers Candidate School. He was commissioned in 1942, and was selected to ship out to combat duty in Africa, but a change in orders sent him to the Dutch West Indies then to Trinidad. Here he was assigned to the 33rd Infantry where he served as XO of Company E. In September 1943 he volunteered for a dangerous and hazardous mission somewhere, and later moved with elements of the 33rd back to the Zl only to ship out from Camp Stoneman on the Lureline to Bom Bay, India. The now First Lieutenant was placed in command of the heavy weapons of one platoon of the six combat teams composing the famous 5307 Provisional Unit known as Merrill's Marauders. The Combat mission behind enemy lines began with a 125 mile conditioning foot march and terminating about 750 miles behind the Japanese units that were confronting friendly Chinese troops in the Mogaung/Hukong valleys of north and central Burma. The unit got the orders to establish and hold a road block for 24 hours on the enemy M.S.R. They held for 38 hours. Finally being able to extract from combat due exclusively to the heavy weapons supporting fires of LT Piazza with disregard for his personal safety observing from an advance position for his mortar and machine guns. The success of this mission denied General Tanaka and the Japanese 1 8th Imperial Division to retake approximately 35 miles of the Hukong valley which had just been liberated by our aggressive position. At the south end of the Mogaung valley, the unit was hit by a series of banzai attacks. Once again, while observing the machine gun and mortar fire at his position from an advance location LT Piazza was hit in the head by two rounds of enemy small arms fire and in the leg by a mortar shell burst. Once again, the effectiveness of heavy weapons enabled the battalion to withdraw to safety. LT Piazza was litter borne about eight miles to an evacuation strip from which, seven days later, he was flown to the 20th General Hospital in India. He spent the next year convalescing before being discharged from active duty. Military awards include the Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman Badge, Purple Heart with cluster, Presidential Unit Citation, and several campaign medals.

Here CPT Stringham gained his reputation as a combat leader who could and would gain and maintain contact with the enemy. Also during the 1965 offensive, CPT Stringham was directed to gather what remained of his camp's indigenous forces after the operation was neutralized by a major communist attack and form a Chinese mercenary battalion, code name "MIKE FORCE", the first of its kind and the subject of the John Wayne movie, "The Green Berets." In his third tour, CPT Stringham again served as a Company Commander and Battalion S-3. During the first moments of the Tet Offensive in 1968, C 4/31, under his command, threw back three all out assaults from a North Vietnamese Regiment. His personal example of calm resolve in the face of danger held the unit together, CPT Stringham personally manned one of his company's machine guns while his company successfully held off the assault from the enemy. From 1975-1979, Major, and then LTC, Stringham commanded three Infantry Battalions, one as a Major, culminating in his assumption of command as the fourth commander of the 1st Ranger Battalion. While he commanded the 1st Ranger Battalion he gained the nickname by his troops of "Smokin' Joe." His tenacity, integrity, lead-from-the-front leadership style and demanding of the highest standards of performance remain a part of the Battalion's fabric today. In the decade of the Eighties, COL Stringham would be assigned to yet another combat assignment as Commander of the U.S. Military Group in El Salvador during the critical phase of the insurgery. Under his direction and hands-on style, the Military Group successfully trained and developed the Salvadoran Armed Forces to the point where they created the security climate in which free elections were successfully held. For his service, COL Stringham received El Salvador's highest military decoration for bravery and meritorious service, "The Medal of Gold". After a successful experience in El Salvador, COL Stringham took command as the fourth Colonel of the newly formed 75th Ranger Regiment. Under his guidance the regiment became the mature and recognized organization it is today. COL Stringham remained in the SOF community upon leaving the 75th Ranger Regiment as the DCG of the USASOC, then 1st SOCOM. BG Stringham retired from active duty on November 30, 1992. He holds two DSM's, and four LOM's, seven combat decorations for valor to include the silver star and six foreign decorations for meritorious and combat service. He was awarded several foreign parachutist wings from the U.K, RVN, Israel, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Panama. His military service brings great credit upon himself, the Special Operations community, and the United States Army.</citation>

Father Basil was born in Enfield, England in 1906 and was ordained a Priest in 1938 in Domodossola, Italy. He remained in Italy teaching until the outbreak of war in 1940. He returned to England where he spent a year as an assistant and joined the Army as a chaplain to the British Army. He was posted to the Army's Commando Training Center near Fort William, Scotland at the time of the arrival of the U.S. Army Rangers. Father Basil joined the Rangers and went to Africa, staying with the Rangers throughout the African Campaign. During a fierce engagement with the Italians, in which the Rangers were taking a considerable number of casualties, Father Basil, speaking Italian, courageously convinced the Italians to surrender. For this heroism he was awarded the Silver Star. When the Rangers were returned to the U.S. command, the British Army ordered Father Basil back to Scotland and the Commando School. He completed his service with the British Commandos, serving in missions to Greece, the Balkans and, again, to Italy. His friendship with Rangers lasted through the years, and he was a guest at a number of reunions until he could no longer attend. Father Basil died on February 2, 1992, and will be missed by all who knew him.

Before volunteering to join Merrill's Marauders for what was termed "a very dangerous mission" by the President of the United States, Staff Sergeant Branscomb saw considerable action with the 161st Infantry at Guadalcanal and New Georgia in the South Pacific. While serving as a lead scout with the 1 st Battalion Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon of Merrill's Marauders in Burma, he repeatedly moved out in front of his combat team, exposing himself to danger numerous times, reconnoitering the terrain, and the enemy's position, gathering information and selecting safe trails to travel by. In preparation for the main attack on the airfield and village of Myitkyina, Staff Sergeant Branscomb's unit was ordered by Colonel Hunter, the Deputy Commander of the Marauders, to move ahead and reconnoiter the strength and disposition of the enemy troops and to check the condition of the runway. He proceeded at night and found gun emplacements surrounding the field as well as a crew of laborers repairing the runway. Staff Sergeant Branscomb reconned the entire airfield and radioed that the airfield would not be safe for the gliders and DC-3s to bring in supplies and much needed medical equipment. He mapped out the position of the emplacements, noted the strength of the enemy, and reported back to his unit. His thoroughness in reconnaissance allowed the Marauders to close with and consistently destroy the remainder of a Chinese Division. Staff Sergeant Branscomb was a man of great experience and valor who exceeded the standard. His actions exemplify a soldier who "moves further, faster, and fights harder than any ether soldier.''</citation>

Command Sergeant Major Burnell served two tours in combat in Vietnam with Company F (LRP), 58th Infantry (Ranger) and Company L (LRP), 75th Rangers and in the Dominican Republic with the 82d Airborne Division. Command Sergeant Major Burnell was cited for exceptional gallantry in action on 7 July 1968 while assigned to Company F (LRP), 58th Infantry (Ranger). Then Sergeant First Class Burnell disregarded his own safety to adjust helicopter gunship fire and fighter bombers against a superior enemy force to extricate his long range patrol team. He directed the napalm and cannon fire within 30 meters of his position and engaged the attacking force with grenades and an intense volume of fire. He ensured that all the members of his team safely boarded before climbing aboard the helicopter. Command Sergeant Major Burnell was severely injured in Vietnam while rappelling from a helicopter. The permanent injury would have crippled most men, but due to his grit and determination he overcame this injury and continued to serve in the Infantry. In 1966 and 1970 to 1976, Command Sergeant Major Burnell served two tours as a Ranger instructor, most notably as the senior tactical noncommissioned officer. He inspired an entire generation of officers, noncommissioned officers and soldiers to attain the "Ranger Standard".</citation>

Graduating from West Point in 1946, he volunteered for airborne training and served with the 11th Airborne Division in occupied Japan. At the onset of the Korean War, Colonel Channon, then a Lieutenant, volunteered for the newly formed Airborne Ranger Companies and arrived in Korea as the Executive Officer for the 3d Airborne Ranger Company in March 1951. On 11 April 1951, Lieutenant Channon's company, along with a company of tanks spearheaded a division attack north from the Imjim River. About mid morning, the company came under devastating small arms and mortar fire from well entrenched enemy forces astride "Bloody Nose Ridge". Out of range of friendly artillery and temporarily separated from supporting armor, the company found itself pinned down. Lieutenant Channon rallied the 1st Platoon and led a successful bayonet charge up and over the ridge and through the dug in enemy. Only seven platoon members and Lieutenant Channon were still on their feet after the enemy was routed. Although sustaining more than 20 entry wounds from mortar and small arms fire, Lieutenant Channon refused to be evacuated until he oversaw the reorganization of the unit, evacuation of the more seriously wounded and had led elements of the company several thousand yards to the company's final objective. After recuperating from his wounds, Ranger Channon later went on several clandestine missions into the islands off the west coast of North Korea where he established contact with and coordinated the efforts of friendly guerrilla units against the common enemy. Later during the Korean War and after the Ranger units were inactivated, Ranger Channon commanded Company I, 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team during combat operations. In the Iron Triangle during the Vietnam War, Ranger Channon served a 27 month continuous tour in the Civil Operations and Rural Development Support as the Director of Territorial Security for all of South Vietnam. He has remained active in the overall Ranger community since his retirement in 1976 and is a Past President of the Ranger Infantry Companies, Airborne. He has also found time to author two books on a Ranger company unit history and another on his experience in Vietnam. His leadership shall never be forgotten among the soldiers that he has served with and led during a long and extremely successful career of service to the nation.</citation>

Crabtree entered the Army, he displayed strong characteristics of a leader and was sent to the Noncommissioned Officers School immediately after Advanced Individual Training. He was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division, where he immediately volunteered for service with Company I (Ranger), 75th Infantry. He became a team leader of a Ranger team, conducting operations deep within enemy occupied territory. For his extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, Sergeant Crabtree distinguished himself on May 11 and 12, 1969 as the leader of a six-man reconnaissance team that was inserted near a rubber plantation at Quang Loi, the site of Viet Cong activities. Sergeant Crabtree's team linked up with another six-man team in a night position. As the darkness and drizzle closed in, the team saw nearly thirty flashlights moving outside their perimeter. Closer and closer the enemy moved as Sergeant Crabtree desperately attempted to establish communications. Finally with a weak signal, he called in artillery and helicopter gunships. An increasing downpour of rain forced the gunships away and the team was left to its own defense. The following morning Sergeant Crabtree organized an ambush on ten enemy soldiers. When six escaped the killing blast and retaliated with a barrage of fire, Sergeant Crabtree led a flanking movement. From a concealed hostile emplacement erupted a fusillade that pinned him down before his maneuver was accomplished. Crawling to the enemy position, he destroyed it with grenades, allowing his team to charge the six enemy who broke and ran. When the team again encountered hostile fire from fortifications, Sergeant Crabtree deployed his men effectively and again crawled up to a machine gun position to knock it out with grenades. Sergeant Crabtree's leadership and personal heroics earned the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and Bronze Star. Sergeant Crabtree is a example of Ranger fortitude and determination and embodies the Ranger creed, "Recognizing that I am a more elite soldier..."</citation>

Ranger Evans led the platoon reconnaissance over the mountain crest, identifying enemy positions and infiltration routes. This action directly resulted in hundreds of enemy POWs being captured. After conducting many hazardous night raids in rugged terrain over eight months throughout North Africa, Ranger Evans' courage and performance as First Sergeant, Sergeant Major, and Platoon Leader merited his selection as company commander when the 3d Ranger Battalion was formed. As Commander of Company F, 3d Ranger Battalion, Ranger Evans earned the Silver Star during the San Pietro Island Raid. Moving over rugged terrain, the company infiltrated and completely surprised the Germans with a ferocious attack under the cover of rain and darkness. During the infamous battle of Cisterna off the Anzio Beachhead in Italy, Ranger Evans maneuvered his company to the sound of battle and attacked into a numerically superior armed German force. Ranger Evans was taken prisoner, but his heroics would continue even after his captivity. After two failed attempts, Ranger Evans successfully escaped and returned to American lines near Liepzig, Germany.

When the Headquarters, 3d Battalion, 1 87th RCT came under attack from a superior force, First Sergeant Frost rallied all Headquarters personnel and fought along with Lieutenant William Gore for over six hours to defeat a North Korean battalion. Because of his demonstrated courage and tactical acumen, First Sergeant Frost was selected by Lieutenant Gore to accompany him and a handpicked force of South Korean raiders (Task Force Red Wing) to be amphibiously inserted behind North Korean lines to raid, ambush, and gather intelligence. His tactical advice, resupply coordination, and courageous presence during long range reconnaissance patrols and agent insertions contributed largely to the success of this mission. Both Lieutenant Gore and First Sergeant Frost were known by name, rank, and service number to the North Koreans and were pursued but never captured as they raided and gathered intelligence behind enemy lines. After several months, newly promoted Captain Gore was stricken with polio. First Sergeant Frost rowed out into the Yellow Sea in a rubber boat until he flagged down a British destroyer to get medical assistance for his crippled friend. When the British diagnosis revealed that Captain Gore required immediate evacuation, First Sergeant Frost successfully coordinated and controlled an aerial medical evacuation by a small fixed-wing aircraft. First Sergeant Frost remained behind as the lone American with this reconnaissance force. Throughout his entire career, this Ranger has always "Led the Way" by his physical presence and personal example.</citation>

Early in the Far Eastern Japanese campaign, Private Janis won the admiration and respect of all members of the platoon for his expertise as a scout and platoon sharpshooter. Private Janis demonstrated his sharpshooting skills by detecting enemy snipers. An example of this skill was demonstrated when the platoon was fighting from Hsam-Shingyang to Nhpum to relieve the 2d Battalion. The I and R platoon leader and combat team commander were standing in a small clearing studying a map when an enemy sniper, located in a tree, fired a single shot. Private Janis observed a slight movement in the vines not obvious to anyone and at a range of about 300 yards dropped the sniper in one shot. Later examination proved it to be a heart shot. Private Janis was awarded the Sioux Tribal Red Feather, equivalent of a Medal of Honor. This is the highest award bestowed by the Sioux Nation for exceptional valor in combat. In his unassuming, quiet manner Private Janis preferred to work alone and identified himself as a ferocious Ranger.

   <citation>All who served with the six Ranger battalions share a mutual respect and gratitude for their chaplains. Armed with their shield of faith, they journeyed into battle side-by-side with well armed Rangers, sharing every danger . For most of us, they are towers of strength, giving us hope and courage. Their mere presence chased the stalking fear of death from Ranger hearts. Such a chaplain was our own 5th Ranger Battalion padre, Captain Joseph Lacy. Monsignor Lacy was ordained in Rome on March 19, 1938. He voluntarily entered the U.S. Army in July 1943 and was assigned to Chaplains School for training. He volunteered for service with the 5th Ranger Battalion in June 1944, just in time for the D-Day operation. He landed in the lead boat on Omaha Dog Green Beach, approximately 7:30 a.m. June 6, 1944. History records the gallantry of General Cota who ignored shot shell and machine gun fire as he walked up the beach urging his 29th Division men to push forward. History should also record that Chaplain Joseph Lacy who, above and far beyond the call of duty, ignoring shot and shell, went to the aid of the wounded and the dying. He prayed and encouraged in his soft spoken manner. For some Rangers, he was their last bond with mankind as they departed this world for God's Kingdom. Chaplain Lacy was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroic and valorous deeds on the Normandy Beachhead and he received the Bronze Star for service with the 5th and 2d Battalions. After his military service, he was called to Rome and given the title of Monsignor. For ten years he served as Chancellor of the Hartford Connecticut Diocese. He was then appointed Chancellor of St. Luke's Parish in Hartford which he calls home. He was called back to Rome and served in the Vatican until 1975 and then returned to St. Luke's. He is a teacher. a scholar. and a man of Faith.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel Ola L. Mize, Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary courage and gallantry. Colonel Mize, then a sergeant, was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on June 10-11, 1953 when serving with Company K, 3d Battalion, 15th Infantry near Surang-ni, Korea. VVhen the enemy launched a heavy attack against a strategic outpost, Sergeant Mize maneuvered through the intense barrage of fire and rescued a wounded soldier. Returning to the main defense line, he established a key defensive position, inflicting heavy casualties against determined enemy assaults, surviving artillery and grenade blasts. When enemy attacks flanked their position, he led his men from bunker to bunker, firing, throwing grenades and destroying the enemy assault. After redistributing ammunition among his men, he noticed the enemy overrunning a friendly machine gun position. He immediately fought his way to the position, killing 10 enemy and forcing the rest to withdraw. Later, securing a radio, he directed artillery fire along the enemy's attack routes. Sergeant Mize and his men held through the night, driving the enemy from the outpost at dawn. Colonel Mize was a pioneer during the early development of Special Forces. As the Chief of the Advanced Training Committee for the Special Forces Training Group, he is credited with the establishment of the modern day SCUBA school. He had several Special Forces commands in Vietnam and later commanded the Special Forces School. Colonel Mize's 31 year career of dedication and service to the US Army has established the example for all future special operatinq forces.</citation>

   <citation>Major Warren E. Allen is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his exceptional leadership and valor while serving as company commander of the legendary 2nd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) during the early part of the Korean War. Major Allen led America's only black Ranger unit from the front in several highly successful engagements, including the first Ranger parachute assault in history. He earned the Silver Star while leading his Rangers against a nearly overwhelming enemy attack. Although wounded in that intense exchange, he led his company in a successful fighting withdrawal. As a Ranger commander, Major Allen displayed great leadership, valor, and compassion for his men. Casualties within his ranks were exceptionally low, considering the precarious assault missions his company was assigned. Simultaneously his units rate of success was notably high. His life, both as an active duty Ranger and as a retired soldier, serves as an inspiration for all Americans. His character, based on a belief in hard work, persistence in achieving goals, and reliability are in the finest traditions of the Rangers and the United States Army.</citation>

After completing basic training at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, he attended Infantry OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia. He then volunteered to fight with Merrill's Marauders in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations. On 29 July 1944, he was the platoon leader of a machine gun platoon attached to Company K, in action near Sitapur, Burma. Machine gun fire from the right flank of the company had held up its advance. After the leader of the right platoon was killed, Lieutenant Delorey, although wounded, went forward at great risk to his life and using a sub-machine gun, killed the enemy machine gun crew. This action allowed the company to continue the advance. Lieutenant Delorey secured the right of the line until a defensive perimeter was established. He was sent to the rear that night for medical care, but returned to action the following morning and led his platoon with skill and daring until he was wounded a second time and forced to leave the field. Lieutenant Delorey's gallant actions were an inspiration to all his comrades and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Armed Forces. Captain Delorey was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, Bronze Star, three Purple Hearts, Combat Infantryman's Badge and numerous campaign ribbons.

   <citation>First Lieutenant Stephen H. Doane is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in the Republic of Vietnam. Lieutenant Doane was serving as a platoon leader in Company B, 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division in the Hau Nghia Province of the Republic of Vietnam. On 25 March 1969, his company was engaged in tactical operations when they made contact with an enemy force concealed in protected bunkers and trenches. Three of the leading soldiers were pinned down by enemy crossfire. After the efforts of the 1st Platoon to rescue these men failed, it became obvious that only a small group could successfully move close enough to destroy the enemy position and rescue the trapped soldiers. First Lieutenant Doane, fully aware of the danger of such an action, crawled to the nearest enemy bunker and destroyed it. He was wounded and continued to advance to a second enemy bunker. As he prepared to throw another grenade, he was wounded again. Undaunted, he deliberately pulled the pin on the grenade and lunged into the enemy bunker, destroying this final obstacle. First Lieutenant Doane's supreme act enabled his company to rescue the trapped men without further casualties. The extraordinary courage and selflessness displayed by this officer was an inspiration to his men and are in the highest traditions of the United States Army Rangers.</citation>

Staff Sergeant Gosho was a member of the Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, 3rd Battalion, 5307th Unit. Staff Sergeant Gosho repeatedly exposed himself to extreme danger by infiltrating the Japanese perimeter and listening to the Japanese officers giving their orders. He was able to return to his platoon and inform his commanding officer of what was going to happen, so they were well prepared for any attack. He was fired on so many times by machine guns, that he was nicknamed "Horizontal Hank" for the number of times he had to hit the ground. Prior to his enlistment, Staff Sergeant Gosho and his family, including his pregnant wife, were forcibly relocated from their home in Seattle, Washington to a Japanese Internment Camp in Idaho. Even under these circumstances, he volunteered to fight for his country. The intelligence information that he repeatedly received was largely responsible for the success of his unit. He was seriously wounded, lost a kidney, and suffered innumerable attacks of malaria, typhus, and jungle rot, and was medically discharged from the Army. Staff Sergeant Gosho is the recipient of the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, Combat Infantryman's Badge and numerous campaign ribbons. After the war, he was the first Japanese-American to be selected by the State Department, and served brilliantly for seventeen years until retirement. In 1954, he entered the U.S. Foreign Service and was assigned to the Public Affairs Office at the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan. In this position, he was very instrumental in cementing relations between the United States and Japan during a period when it was crucial to the success of United States activities in Japan.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel John P. Lawton is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his extraordinary valor and service to this great nation of ours as a Ranger and soldier of thirty seven and one half years. His service with the Biet Dong Quan as an advisor to the Vietnamese 41st Ranger Battalion as company commander of Company N (Ranger), 75th Infantry provided examples of personal determination to all who served with him. For extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star with "V" device and five Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal with "V" device and three Oak Leaf clusters, Purple Heart with four Oak Leaf clusters, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Bronze and Silver Star, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. In addition to his wartime service, a grateful nation has awarded him the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with Oak Leaf cluster, Soldier's Medal and Army Commendation Medal. He has also been awarded the Senior Parachutist Badge, the Vietnamese Ranger Badge, and the coveted Ranger Tab. Colonel (CPT) Lawton distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions as the company commander of an Infantry company during a mission near Chu Lai. He received word that his second platoon had been heavily attacked in an open rice paddy by an estimated North Vietnamese Army company firing automatic weapons and mortars and had suffered many casualties. Captain Lawton evaluated the situation and led a squad across 50 meters of open ground. He received multiple fragment wounds as he advanced. Disregarding his severe wounds, he continued to crawl to the casualties, only to discover they were all either dead or could not be moved. For a full 45 minutes he single-handedly held the attackers at bay and prevented them from capturing the wounded. He placed suppressive fire on the insurgents until he ran out of ammunition and his position was overrun. With a burst of reserve energy he lunged forward to grab a weapon from one of the enemy, but was wounded for a fourth time and left for dead. Through his courageous actions he had delayed the enemy force to such an extent that when the relief force arrived moments later, the attackers were caught in the open and were quickly routed, suffering heavy casualties. For this action Colonel Lawton was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Colonel Lawton has always demonstrated that he will energetically meet the enemy of his country and defeat them on the field of battle, fight with all his might and never leave a fallen comrade.

   <citation>Colonel Lewis Millett, Medal of Honor recipient, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary feats of courage and outstanding contributions to the Ranger concept during 34 years of military service. Colonel Millett began his military service with the Massachusetts National Guard in 1939. Anxious to participate in WW II, he joined the Canadian Armed Services in 1941 and attained the rank of Gunner. Following the entry of the U.S. into WWII, he was discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and joined the U.S. Army in time to participate in the North African and Italian campaigns as an artilleryman with the 1st Armored Division. While serving in these campaigns, he received the Silver Star for driving a burning ammunition half-track out of his battery's firing position, and was promoted to Corporal for heroically downing a German ME-109 that was strafing his artillery position. He received a battlefield commission in November 1944. In 1945, Colonel Millett was discharged from active duty and reentered the National Guard. In 1949, Colonel Millett returned to active duty and in 1950 deployed to Korea as a forward observer with the 8th Field Artillery Battalion. In recognition of his proven combat leadership potential, he was awarded command of Company E, 27th Infantry on January 1, 1951. While serving as a company commander during the January - March 1951 Korean Counteroffensive, he won the Distinguished Service Cross and was later awarded the Medal of Honor for leading what has been called "…the heaviest bayonet charge since Cold Harbor in the Civil War." Colonel Millett received his Ranger Tab in 1958. During his subsequent assignment to the 101st Airborne Division, he used his combined Canadian Army, combat, and Ranger training experiences to establish the Recondo School - a combat realistic small unit training program later used as a prototype for forming Recondo units in U.S. Army and Marine Corps Infantry divisions. In August 1960, he was sent to MAAG Vietnam to establish the Republic of Vietnam Ranger program and serve as the first Republic of Vietnam Ranger Command advisor. During subsequent assignments in Vietnam and Laos, he applied Ranger/Recondo concepts in conducting training and covert operational activities of certain indigenous special operational units. Throughout his long illustrious military career and in his active retirement life, Colonel Millett has led the way in applying the Ranger Creed of leadership, loyalty, daring and dependability - a true Ranger's Ranger.</citation>

On 14 December 1944, at Cognon, Leyte, Lieutenant Nett led his company in an attack against a reinforced enemy battalion which had held up the American advance for two days. Advancing against heavy enemy machine gun and other automatic weapons fire, 1LT Nett spearheaded the assault against a strongpoint. During the fierce hand-to-hand encounter, he killed seven Japanese soldiers with his rifle and bayonet and, himself seriously wounded, gallantly continued to lead his men forward. Again he was severely wounded, but still unwilling to retire, pressed ahead with his troops to ensure the capture of the objective. Wounded once more in the final assault, he calmly made all arrangements for the resumption of the advance, turned over his command to another officer, and then walked unaided to the rear for medical treatment. For his actions he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

Lieutenant Colonel (then Major) Sullivan volunteered for and was accepted to serve as the first battalion executive officer for the 5th Ranger Battalion in 1943. Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry at Omaha Beach during 6-10 June 1944. Completely disregarding his own safety, he personally directed a successful landing operation and led his men across the beach covered with machine gun, artillery, and rocket fire. After reorganizing his men, he immediately resumed his duties as battalion executive officer and was placed in command of two Ranger companies which fought their way inland against fierce opposition to join and relieve the Ranger detachment. After laying communications through the enemy lines under cover of darkness, Major Sullivan directed the Rangers' progress cross-country. In cooperation with other infantry units, an attack was begun on an artillery battery. When certain elements were temporarily halted by artillery fire, Major Sullivan, who had been wounded, calmly and courageously rallied his officers and men, ordered a renewal of the attack, and instead of bypassing the resistance, advanced over heavily mined terrain to capture the battery. This move resulted in a loss of only fifteen men. Eighty six prisoners and several large caliber artillery pieces in concrete bunkers were captured. Attacks by Major Sullivan's command contributed greatly to the success of the XX Corps operations. In July 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan assumed command of the 5th Ranger Battalion. He continued his exemplary leadership in the Battle for Brest, and battles at Trier, Saarburg, and Irsch-Zerf. Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan commanded the 5th Ranger Battalion for ten of the eleven months it was in combat. During that time, the Battalion never failed to accomplish any of its assigned missions. By his intrepid direction, heroic leadership and superior professional ability, Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan set an inspiring example for his command, reflecting the highest traditions of the Armed Forces.

CPT Block was distinguished by his enthusiasm, courage under fire, attention to duty, and most of all, his intense concern for the health, well-being and effectiveness of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. He was a physician who never hesitated to go in harm's way to care for a Ranger, a spirit his medics emulated.† At Pointe du Hoc, ignoring intense fire from the enemy, he set up a temporary aid station at the base of the cliff, and directed the care of any wounded whom he could not tend to himself. After the top was gained he did not hesitate to leave the upper aid station to attend wounded in the field, frequently under heavy fire. Among those he treated was COL Rudder who had been hit a second time while at an outpost.† During the battle of Huertgen Forest the battalion suffered losses at Hill 400 equal to, or higher than, on D-Day. During this, a shell burst on the roof of the aid station killing CPT Block while he was tending the wounded and checking on their evacuation.† His gallantry in action, courage and performance in organizing medical-surgical care while under heavy fire at Pointe du Hoc was recognized in the form of a Silver Star. Later, he earned the Bronze Star and, finally, the Purple Heart.</citation>

   <citation>Command Sergeant Major Gary Carpenter is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary service to the Nation as a Ranger leader. CSM Carpenter has served in every enlisted leadership position from Fire Team Leader to Command Sergeant Major of U.S. Army Pacific Command in charge of 50,000 soldiers. CSM Carpenter is a standard bearer to all who have come in contact with him. He has served combat tours in both Vietnam with the 173rd Infantry (Airborne) and in Grenada with the 1st Ranger Battalion. On 23 Oct 198, as the Command Sergeant Major of the 1st Ranger Battalion, CSM Carpenter was alerted to deploy to the Island of Grenada as part of OPERATION URGENT FURY. In the dawn's early light on 25 Oct 1983, flying in at 500 feet on a C-130, CSM Carpenter made a daring combat parachute assault onto Point Salinas Airfield. Only 32 Rangers exited the aircraft on the first pass, one of which was CSM Carpenter. He immediately came under fire from Cuban Regulars and Grenadan militia. His audacious and daring leadership enabled this small element to withhold the enemy until the remainder of the Ranger force arrived on the second pass and overwhelmed the enemy force. It was the discipline, high standards, and charismatic leadership of CSM Carpenter that caused him to be selected as the first Regimental Command Sergeant Major of the 75th Ranger Regiment in 1984. He embedded these same high standards and discipline into the Non-Commissioned Officers and all those he came in contact with through out the Regiment, giving us the legacy that is the 75th Ranger Regiment today. CSM Gary Carpenter has led the way for others to follow in every aspect of service to the Rangers and the Nation.</citation>

   <citation>Brigadier General Richard J. Eaton is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for uncommon valor and selfless gallantry as he led the way during his distinguished military career of 33 years. General Eaton entered the Army in World War II. He served as an enlisted man in the 517th Parachute Combat Team. He fought in Italy, made the combat jump into Southern France and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. On April 23, 1951 in North Korea, 1LT Eaton joined the 3rd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne). On that day, the Ranger Company's mission was to "break through a U.N. Brigade, cut off behind enemy lines. A numerically superior enemy force ambushed the 3rd Ranger Company enroute to the objective. 1LT Eaton, fully exposed with enemy machine gun bullets cracking all around him and kicking up dirt between his feet, led the Rangers in a fighting withdrawal, leaving many enemy dead and wounded. He led the Rangers to the top of the highest mountain nearby. All through that night and the next day, Ranger Eaton adjusted artillery fire on the massed enemy soldiers, inflicting heavy casualties. He led the Rangers several miles through the enemy units to friendly lines. Ranger Eaton led all platoon-size reconnaissance and combat patrols in 3rd Ranger Company during June-July 1951. He led 3rd Ranger Company's last combat patrol and commanded the 3rd Rangers in their last fire fight with the enemy in North Korea. After Korea, he served in a variety of command and staff positions. During the Vietnam War, Ranger Eaton distinguished himself as the Commander of 2nd Battalion, 16 Infantry.

   <citation>Ranger Richard "Dick" Ehrler is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his extraordinary valor in combat and his contributions to the Ranger community for many years. Ranger Ehrler served as a Team Leader with Echo Company, 50th Infantry, Long Range Patrol, of the 9th Infantry Division. During his tour in Vietnam, he was awarded the Silver Star for valor, the Army Commendation Medal with "V" device for valor, the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf cluster, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star, and the coveted Combat Infantryman's Badge. Ranger Ehrler's citation for the award of the Silver Star reflects the ideals of the Ranger Creed. "When his team's night position came under attack from a numerically superior hostile force, Sergeant Ehrler, though seriously wounded in the initial moments of the contact, maintained full command of his men and directed gunship strikes against the enemy. He braved the murderous barrage of hostile fire to load casualties onto a medical evacuation helicopter and then made sure there was no equipment left behind before the remainder of the team was extracted." The citation refers to "seriously wounded". Ranger Ehrler was permanently blinded early in the contact, and half of his six man team had been killed. Ranger Ehrler's actions demonstrated that "surrender is not a Ranger word", and that "I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy." Ranger Ehrler has refused to allow his wounds to limit his activities. His contributions to his community, the Ranger community in general, and his "leading the way" as the current President of the 75th Ranger Regiment Association reflect his passion for life. Ranger Ehrler is a past Vice President of the 75th Ranger Regiment Association, he has compiled a list of all known LRRP, LRP, Ranger, and Ranger Advisors who died in the Vietnam War. He has been a force in the drive to purchase and place, in the Ranger Memorial, a memorial brick in the walkway for each of those brave men who paid the ultimate price. Over 380 total bricks have been placed in the walkway as a direct result of his efforts. Anyone who is fortunate enough to make Ranger Ehrler's acquaintance, soon finds out that this man is an inspiration to everyone he comes in contact with, despite his loss of sight. Ranger Ehrler's devotion to duty during war and peace demonstrate the true Ranger spirit and determination to allow no obstacle in the path to completing the Ranger mission. Ranger Richard Ehrler truly does "Lead the Way".</citation>

   <citation>Colonel William Osbourne is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for outstanding service as a Ranger Officer. COL Osbourne's Army career is a sage of quiet heroism in combat and unswerving devotion to his country. Cadet Captain and ROTC Honor Graduate from UCLA in 1936. Commissioned in 1940 in the Regular Army as 2nd lieutenant in the 7th Inf Div Ft Ord, CA on Sept 1, 1941. He was sent to Luzon as a Company Commander of a Philippine Scout Company. On Dec 7, 1941 at the outbreak of WWII he was given command of the 2nd Battalion, 51st INF Philippine Army, a unit of the Philippine Reserves called to active duty. Bataan surrendered April 9, 1941. Knowing it to be certain death if later captured, he and 3 of his surviving men, not wanting to be a Japanese POW, played cat and jungle mouse with the Japanese for weeks, working their way through the jungle, toward the beach. Hidden in a Nipa Hut for the next 2 months by Philippine partisans, he linked up with an AF pilot, LT Damon Guase, who had soldiered until the fall of Corregidor as an infantryman. He located an old 22 foot sailboat with a one cylinder engine. With a National Geographic map and an Army field compass as navigational instruments, they set sail for Wyndham, Australia. After a 3000 mile hazardous journey through Japanese patrolled open seas, buffeted by storms and a typhoon, and strafed by enemy planes and patrol boats, they reached there destination. They were both awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by General Douglass Macarthur personally for their exploits and logging detailed notes of Japanese troop dispositions, enemy shipping, names of service men who had not surrendered, including their serial numbers, and the state of Philippine morale. COL Osbourne then volunteered, at the request of President Roosevelt, for a "dangerous and hazardous unknown mission" with Merrill's Marauders, where he was Commander of the First Battalion Red and White combat teams. He distinguished himself with his leadership during the long campaign behind enemy lines, leading to the capture of the airfield and City of Mytkyiana.</citation>

Captain Parker, then a Second Lieutenant, volunteered for and was to serve with the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion when formed in 1943. Promotion to company commander came rapidly thereafter. Captain Parker distinguished himself on D-Day, June 6, 1944 when he led a platoon (minus) cross country to Chateau de Vermicel but found no Rangers at the planned assembly area. Heading west toward Pointe du Hoc, he captured 13 enemy soldiers, disarmed them, and humanely told them to head to the rear, thereby probably starting the massive flood of Germans who later surrendered. Soon after, he found himself completely surrounded, requiring a desperate fight out of the trap. He and his men did reach the Pointe and assisted the 2d Rangers desperately in need of assistance. Captain Parker's action, which earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, was repeated many times at Brest, Oberleuken, where Company A tried to extract Companies B and F from an electric minefield and tank trap, and later at Irsch-Zerf where he took positions on line to repel repeated enemy attacks. General Norman D. Cota, on Omaha Beach, told Company A to, "Lead the way, Rangers." Captain Parker did lead the way, all the way, until war's end, as expected of a true Ranger.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Eugene C. Rivera is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary bravery during armed combat. On the 22nd of April 1951, 350,000 Chinese troops launched their largest offensive of the Korean War. The attack broke the 6th Republic of Korea Division that retreated 21 miles, leaving the right flank of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division exposed. The Commanding General of the 24th ID sent the 90 men of the 8th Ranger Infantry Company into this void. Climbing high mountains, the Rangers reconnoitered Chinese movement. Communications Chief Corporal Rivera reported the movement and adjusted artillery fire on the enemy. Thousands of Chinese bypassed the Rangers. A large force occupied the strategic hill 628 and prepared to launch an attack to cut off U.S. forces. To disrupt the enemy, the 8th Airborne Ranger Company attacked the Chinese force and a furious firefight erupted with heavy losses on each side. More Chinese units engaged from the flanks and the rear. The Ranger Company Commander, 1st and 3rd platoon leaders, and the artillery observer were casualties. Using the only operating radio left to the rangers, CPL Rivera adjusted artillery fire and sought assistance. Friendly forces could not break through. The Rangers were ordered to " Get out as best you can." Nearly a third of the Rangers were casualties. No Ranger would leave the wounded. Their leaders looked for a place to make the final stand. Looking to the valley floor, CPL Rivera saw American tanks withdrawing. CPL Rivera climbed a barren hill and under heavy and continuous fire established and maintained radio contact with a tank platoon leader who held his tanks 3'500 meters forward of friendly positions. Due to Corporal Rivera's extraordinary bravery, the Rangers were able to break the encirclement, and carrying their wounded, link up with the courageous tankers. Corporal Rivera saved his company.</citation>

   <citation>Private First Class Leo Samborowski is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary bravery during armed combat. Leo joined Company F of the 5th Ranger Battalion in September 1943 at Camp Forrest, Tennessee. He was a quiet, unassuming man who seemed to be comfortable with himself which permitted people to feel at ease with him. He accepted orders without complaint or resentment and was respected by those who served with him. On or about 3 December 1944 Company F was ordered to attack the town of Lauterback, Germany. The men moved through a heavily wooded area to the edge of an open field; the objective was a row of houses about 300 yards away. The ground sloped gently down to the village and was relatively flat except for a drainage ditch to the right front of the attacking company. Leo was a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) gunner in the platoon that led the assault; when it was about a 100 yards from the objective, withering small arms fire erupted from well concealed enemy positions. A machine gun in the aforementioned ditch and another on the left caught the men in a very effective cross fire; a devastating barrage of mortar and artillery added to their woes. Leo moved into a position that enabled him to engage the two machine guns. In an effort to assist other Rangers trying to flank the machineguns PFC Somborowski moved forward in a withering hail of bullets and fired 8 magazines, killing the crew of one machine gun. He suppressed the second machine gun long enough for some Rangers to get behind the enemy; however, the machine gun was solely focused on PFC Samborowski and he was killed by a hail of bullets getting hit over 100 times. Leo was a veteran of the battles for Normandy and Brest; there is no doubt in anyone's mind that he knew what he was doing. He gave up his life bravely performing the job he was trained to do. In so doing, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, posthumously, for valor in battle.</citation>

Recognizing the hazards of his chosen profession, he volunteered for airborne and Ranger training. After completion of his education at Stanford, CPT Bucha sought airborne duty in the 101st Airborne Division, and was immediately assigned to company command where he was tasked to build and train an understrengthed rifle company for deployment to Vietnam. Using his Ranger skills, CPT Bucha’s focus was on night operations and team building, which bore fruit in December 1967 when his company deployed to War Zone C, Northwest of Saigon. Very quickly the troopers of Company D were identified as the most effective in the 3d Brigade, wreaking havoc on any enemy encountered. On March 18, after pursuing enemy forces in Binh Duong Province for three days of heavy contact, CPT Bucha’s company had a meeting engagement with a North Vietnamese Army Battalion while preparing for bivouac. He quickly organized a hasty perimeter defense to ward off the attacks of this superior enemy force. Aware that a heavy machine gun was placing effective fire into his position, CPT Bucha crawled forward and, single-handedly,† destroyed the machine gun with grenades. Wounded, while returning to his position, he rallied his men and encouraged them, while adjusting artillery on all sides. Concerned for his wounded, which included all of his platoon leaders, CPT Bucha called for aerial medical evacuation and moved to an exposed clearing to supervise that evacuation while personally adjusting suppressive fires from an Air Force gunship. At dawn, the enemy broke contact leaving 156 KIA on the jungle battlefield. Ranger Bucha’s high standards, tough training, and team building had paid off. Upon his return to the United States, he was assigned as an instructor at the United States Military Academy. His instruction was characterized by tough, rigorous training top convey Combat Lessons Learned to his cadet students. Upon Leaving the military to pursue a business career, Ranger Bucha returned often to West Point to speak to the cadets, to remind all that each person has the potential to do something extraordinary, if they continue to strive and don’t give up. His success in the military, in business, and in life is based strongly on the axiom that “surrender” is not a Ranger word.</citation>

In Europe, he was assigned as a platoon leader of a Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Platoon and shortly thereafter as a Project Officer to develop the V Corps Long Range Reconnaissance Company. He did so well in both assignments that he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal, which was unusual for a Lieutenant in that time frame. As an ROTC Instructor at the University of Tennessee, he organized and formed the first ROTC Ranger Company in America. Upon deployment to Vietnam, he was selected by LTC Bob Kingston to be the first Senior Advisor to the 1st Vietnamese Ranger Group, a newly-formed organization to coordinate the tactical deployment of the I Corps Ranger Battalions.† During this period of political unrest and coups, the 11th Vietnamese Ranger Battalion revolted with the Catholics and Buddhists occupying opposing defensive positions.† Alone and unarmed, he approached each group and convinced them to return to government service. After nine months of combat, Ranger Daniel was severely wounded. He refused medical evacuation, until the tactical situation warranted and he could brief his replacement. The wound was so severe that it appeared Ranger Daniel would have to be medically retired, but by dogged determination and intense willpower, he not only rehabilitated himself to be retained on active duty, but to be deployed again to Vietnam. He was the logical choice to become the Senior Advisor to the 2d Vietnamese Ranger Group, the only American to serve two tours as a Ranger Advisor at Group Level. He was so well regarded that he was given the additional duty to advise the 42nd Regiment, a combat unit needing retraining. Through his efforts, the combat capability was raised significantly and it became a vital force in combat actions in the II Corps. LTC Daniel was decorates several times for valor but uniquely he was awarded the Vietnamese Cross for Gallantry with Palm, with Gold Star, and with the Silver Star, the three highest awards in Vietnam, which were not given freely to advisors. Throughout his entire career, this Ranger has always “Led the Way” by his physical and personal example.</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel Caifson Johnson is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary service to the nation. He joined Merrill’s Marauders first campaign in Burma as commanding officer of the white combat team, 1st battalion. After the capture of the airfield at Myitkyina, and having participated in 35 battles without any relief or replacements, the Marauders were decimated form battle casualties, sickness, and disease. Although he was eligible to be rotated home, LTC Johnson elected to remain with his men and assumed command of the 1st Battalion. The remnants of the Regiment were reformed and reorganized into the 475th Infantry Regiment for the next phase of the arduous campaign and continued onto China. His leadership, according to Major General Ernest Easterbrook, the Commanding Officer, was so dynamic that many soldiers volunteered to stay on the mission. He commanded with great distinction, always leading the way, and on many occasions was seen to carry multiple packs and rifles of men who had become too exhausted on the treacherous mountain trails. He was a true leader. Shortly after his retirement from the Army, after 30 years of service, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was honored in July, 1965 by the Freedom Foundation at Valley Forge with the George Washington Honor Medal.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant First Class Donald L. Lehew is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his outstanding contribution to the U.S. Army and his supreme sacrifice for his country while fighting in Vietnam. Sergeant Lehew enlisted in the Army in 1953 and was trained as a unit supply specialist. Later he served as a light weapons infantryman, becoming a fire team leader and squad leader in the 82d Airborne Division. Sergeant Lehew completed the Fort Bragg NCO Academy, Basic NCO Course, Jumpmaster Course, and Ranger School in 1958. Sergeant Lehew served with distinction as senior instructor in the Florida Ranger Camp from 1962 to 1964. He then volunteered for Special Forces where he completed the Operations and Intelligence Specialist Course and was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group, 1st SF (Abn), Republic of Vietnam. As Intelligence Sergeant, he participated in numerous combat operations in the IV Corps Tactical Zone where he earned several awards, to include two Purple Hearts. He was awarded the Bronze Star with “V” Device for heroic actions on May 18, 1966 when he exposed himself to enemy fire to save the life of a reconnaissance team leader and retrieve a Viet Cong prisoner from a river near Ong Boi Hamlet. On August 26, 1966, Sergeant Lehew distinguished himself on a mission on Phu Quoc Island. He skillfully deployed his troops to break up an enemy ambush. Under intense enemy fire, he helped move a wounded comrade to safety where he administered first aide. While assisting evacuating the dead and wounded from the battlefield, Sergeant Lehew noticed a Vietcong soldier firing from a bunker and pushed his commander to the ground, saving the officer’s life. As his unit moved to join a relief force, two Viet Cong companies opened fire from entrenched positions, momentarily disorganizing his troops. He rallied his troops, then charged alone into the heavy enemy fusillade, deliberately assaulting the main insurgent position. He was mortally wounded while fearlessly and unselfishly placing the welfare of his men above his own in the heat of battle. His quick action threw off the enemy air support and prevented the friendly force from being overwhelmed.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger John L. McCoy is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his outstanding service as a Ranger throughout his career, and for extraordinary heroism in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. Sergeant First Class McCoy began his military service with the Canadian Army as a machine gunner with the Winnipeg Grenadiers during the defense of Hong Kong. In December 1941, Sergeant McCoy was seriously wounded during house-to-house fighting in that city and became a prisoner of war. He endured 45 months of barbarous imprisonment, and after the Japanese surrendered, Sergeant McCoy testified to convict his Japanese captors for war crimes, resulting in their life imprisonment in San Quentin. When fighting broke out in Korea, Sergeant McCoy again volunteered for service, this time in the U.S. Army as a member of the 23D Regiment, 2D Infantry Division. As a member of a raider platoon, Sergeant McCoy volunteered for many raid patrols behind Chinese communist forces lines and distinguished himself under fire as an indomitable fighter and brilliant leader who would not leave a fallen comrade. He later volunteered for Vietnam and his third major conflict as an assistant advisor the the 43d Ranger Battalion. After a thwarted coup attempt, the Vietnamese battalion commander was relieved. Fearing reprisals from the Vietnamese Rangers, the Ranger battalion advisor was reassigned. Sergeant McCoy refused reassignment and was so respected by the Rangers, that no reprisals took place. Remaining as the lone American Ranger advisor, he continued his duties until an officer could be added to the team. On 26 September 1964, after rescuing a wounded company commander and carrying him to safety, Sergeant McCoy directed counterattacks and, at times, joined the assaulting forces to lead by his personal example. When the assault failed, Sergeant McCoy moved from position to position, directing fire and the placement of weapons until he was mortally wounded. Ranger McCoy was decorated, posthumously, with the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for valor (2d award) for these sequential acts of valor. Sergeant First Class McCoy lived the Ranger Creed in three wars, even before there was a Ranger Creed, distinguishing himself by indomitable spirit and his inspiring to fight on to the Ranger objective, while never leaving a fallen comrade on the field of battle.</citation>

   <citation>Major Robert W. Prince is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary valor and heroic service to the nation as a Ranger leader. His battalion commander, LTC Henry A. Mucci, chose then Captain Prince to command Company C, 6th Ranger Battalion. As company commander he participated in numerous combat operations in the Pacific Theater, from Hollandia to Leyte. He also participated in the occupation of Japan immediately following the end of hostilities in the Pacific. He was given the task of planning and execution the daring Prisoner of War raid at Cabanatuan in the Philippines from January 28-31, 1945. This particular raid is recognized as a virtually flawless special operation, and is highly regarded as the most successful raid of its kind during World War II. Overall control of the operation was given to LTC Mucci, but CPT Prince was solely responsible the conduct of Company C and a Platoon from Company F. Captain Prince infiltrated his element via foot movement 29-miles behind enemy lines. He culminated this arduous journey by having his Rangers low crawl the last mile to the enemy compound, during hours of limited visibility, achieving tactical surprise, his men quickly overwhelmed the numerically superior force in the large garrison and freed over 500 American and Allied Prisoners. The Rangers then led or carried the emaciated men 30 miles back to friendly lines. The 6th Battalion sustained 2 KIA and ten WIA. Enemy losses were 200 KIA. Captain Prince was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. He was promoted to Major in August 1945. Major Prince’s selfless service and dedication to duty are in the highest traditions of Ranger leadership and exemplify our motto, ”Rangers Lead the Way!”</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Major Arthur A. Werner is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for outstanding service to the nation. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in March 1941 at age 16 and was assigned to the 35th Infantry Washington National Guard in Hawaii. Sergeant Major Werner was at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. Afterwards, he was sent to Solomon Islands where he fought the Japanese at Guadalcanal. Promoted to corporal, he led recon patrols and ambush patrols into the enemy infested jungles of Bloody Ridge and Hill 27. For his gallantry in action at Guadalcanal, he received his first award for outstanding courage in attacking a strong point ring of fifty Japanese pillboxes and resisting repeated attacks by an Infantry regiment. This action lasted for three weeks until a decision was made to use a tank to break up the positions. He then volunteered to lead a patrol following the tank to protect its occupants from antitank grenades and he volunteered to join the famed Merrill’s Marauders for a secret mission behind the enemy lines in Burma. While the 2d battalion (Marauder’s) were surrounded on the Hill at Phpum ga, he repeatedly led patrols to try and break through and carried some of his wounded men to safety despite being wounded trying to knock out a machinegun nest. After three years in action in the pacific war zone, he returned to civilian life in Tacoma, Wa. In 1948, he joined the California National Guard, was promoted to 2d Lieutenant, and later volunteered to go to Korea when war broke out. Discharged from the Army in September 1952, he then joined the reserves. In 1955, he again joined the active Army as a sergeant. In 1966 he deployed to Vietnam as the First Sergeant of Company B, 2d Battalion, 22nd Infantry where he served two tours between 1966 and 1967, and in 1969, volunteered again for a third tour. After 30 years, he retired from the Army. His awards include CIB with 2 stars, two Silver Stars, one Bronze Star for valor, four Bronze Stars for Meritorious Service, two Purple Hearts, and numerous campaign and service decorations.</citation>

   <citation>Master Sergeant William E. Butler is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his extraordinary valor, and 43-years of dedicated service to this nation as a Ranger. Master Sergeant Butler’s dedication to his country began in 1946 when he attended basic infantry training and lasted through 1989, when he performed his last jump at the age of 59. He has mentored and trained Ranger troops during peacetime and war, as well as performing acts of valor while engaging the enemy in combat. During his first two tours in the Korean War, MSG Butler was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman’s Badge, and Purple Heart. His fire team spotted an enemy element trying to cut off the unit’s line of withdrawal. He moved his team to a more effective position and brought the platoon-size enemy element under automatic fire. Though wounded twice in the engagement, then, Corporal Butler moved from position-to-position to direct accurate fire upon the enemy. Disregarding enemy fire and his own safety, Corporal Butler directed air-support upon the enemy element until they broke contact and fled. He then led his small fire team out of the enemy area to safety. During training for Vietnam at Fort Benning, he was awarded the Soldiers Medal when he saved a soldier from drowning during a river crossing exercise. While in Vietnam he was awarded his second Silver Star, Combat Infantryman’s Badge, and Purple Heart. His team spotted two enemy soldiers moving in the area. After an hour and half of observation, the enemy element increased in size to over thirty troops. Suddenly the enemy soldiers moved into an assault formation and began advancing toward the five-man team. As the hostile troops began firing, then Sergeant Butler disregarding the enemy fusillade, opened fire with his rifle. Though wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade, he maneuvered forward to effectively engage an enemy rocket-propelled grenade team. An accurate burst from Sergeant Butler’s rifle hit and detonated one of the grenades, killing both members of the enemy weapons team. His devotion to the Rangers would bring him to take a voluntary administrative reduction in rank in order to remain the Operations Sergeant for the LRS detachment that he organized and trained in 1986. His legendary career goes to the heart of the Ranger Creed and is an inspiration to all past, present, and future Rangers.</citation>

In response to ominous signs of a pending world conflict, Ranger Clement joined the U.S. Army in June 1941, and fought 41 months in the Pacific Islands as a machine gunner and expert demolitionist. Shortly after the Korean War started he volunteered to fight there as a Ranger, but was promoted and selected to remain at Fort Benning as an instructor. Shortly thereafter he volunteered again and was assigned to the 32d Infantry and was hand-picked to organize and lead a raider platoon against menacing enemy forces entrenched in the Iron Triangle. Clement’s Raiders turned the enemy tide and filled a critical void left by the formally assigned 2d Ranger Company. Within four months he was awarded three medals for heroism, received two purple hearts, promoted to master sergeant and granted a battlefield commission. In 1960, Ranger Clement and two Special Forces professionals were called to affect a daring rescue in the Congo. The country had just won its independence and was in a state of crisis. Mutiny and rebellion were rampant. A soviet ideologue was vying for power and hundreds of missionaries and doctors were being held hostage. In three weeks 239 people were rescued and safely evacuated from various tribal areas. The mission ranks as a huge special operations success story. He was indeed the embodiment of Ranger Excellence. His induction symbolizes the contributions of this most extraordinary Ranger.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Emmett E. Fike distinguished himself as a leader in heavy fighting while in the Counter Fire Platoon of the 187th Regimental Combat Team (ARCT) on TDY to the 1st Cavalry Division. In just three weeks of fighting the platoon of 22 men lost their officer and 10 enlisted men including five Rangers. It was then and there that the zeal was ignited in Ranger Fike to memorialize his fallen comrades. He was determined that they would not be forgotten. Ranger Fike later fought with the 187th Regimental Combat Team in the re-taking of Koji-do Island POW Camp and in the Kumwa Valley attached to the 7th Division. During these campaigns more of his friends were lost and his zeal became a vow. In 1984 Ranger Fike helped organize the Ranger Infantry Companies Association (RICA) and served as president from 1987 to 1989. His battlefield vow to his fallen Ranger comrades had not diminished and in March 1985 he volunteered to serve as RICA’s Memorial Affairs Officer, a position that he holds to this day. In that capacity Ranger Fike has visited the graves of 58 Rangers killed-in-action and has held 53 memorials at Ranger gravesites and installed 69 bronze Ranger scrolls on the gravestones of Rangers whom were killed in action. This is work that he loves, in which he continues to be active. Ranger Fike worked tirelessly, often fighting uphill battles for the establishment, the site selection, the naming of Ranger Field at Fort Benning, Georgia, and for the construction and upgrading of the monument that bears the names of fallen Rangers.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant William Kirshfield was born at Fort Benning, Georgia on January 27, 1927. He served with honor in the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, and then joined the U.S. Army in 1950. Ranger Kirshfield was an original member of the 5th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne). His principle job was that of a Browning Automatic Rifleman (BAR) within the 2d platoon. In early April 1951, Ranger Kirshfield and his fellow members of the 5th Airborne Ranger Company were attached to U.S. 25th Infantry Division while fighting in Korea. On the morning of 10 April 1951, the 5th Airborne Company was assigned the mission of infiltrating the Chinese lines and seizing Hill 383, a dominating terrain feature to the rear of Chinese positions. It was anticipated that the Chinese would be occupying the hill and surprise was critical to the Ranger success. When the 5th Rangers had seized the objective, other forces from the Division would attack the Chinese lines from the front and flank, break the Chinese line and relieve the Rangers on Hill 383. As soon as it was dark, the Rangers moved from concealed positions and crossed the Hantan River. Ranger Kirshfield led a scouting party and reported important information back to his unit. Despite heavy fighting, the 5th Ranger Company succeeded in taking the objective and paving the way for the 25th Infantry division attack. Relief did not come. The heavily entrenched Chinese chose to attack on three sides of the hill, the fourth being a cliff face that the enemy deemed an unsuitable avenue of approach. Ranger Kirshfield again voluntarily placed himself in harms way. Moving forward on the slope of the hill, he provided early warning to his unit, alerting them to the oncoming Chinese. There lead elements discovered, the Chinese pounded the Ranger position with mortar fire. Ranger Kirshfield's position took a direct hit killing his assistant gunner and severely wounding him from the waist down. The ensuing battle raged for forty minutes with Rangers inflicting a heavy toll on the enemy. Chinese reinforcements continued to pout in and concentrate on the flanks of the perimeter. It soon became evident that this engagement, being fought deep within enemy territory, would soon overwhelm the small Ranger force. With the Chinese attacking the hill on three sides, the decision was made to withdraw to friendly lines. In order to accomplish this the Chinese had to be contained for a short time longer. Sergeant Kirshfield, though badly wounded, unselfishly volunteered to remain behind to provide covering fire while the remainder of the platoon and company withdrew. When last observed, Ranger Kirshfield was still firing his Browning Automatic Rifle to ward off the enemy assault. Sergeant William Kirshfield sacrificed his life that dark night so that his Ranger comrades could live to fight another day. His example goes to the heart and soul of the Ranger Creed and is an inspiration to all present and future Rangers.</citation>

After completing Basic, Advanced Infantry, Airborne, and Noncommissioned Officer Leadership Training, and while serving as a staff noncommissioned officer at Fort Benning, First Sergeant Lesley requested orders for Vietnam. He arrived in Vietnam 6 June 1969 and was assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade, but sought out opportunities to volunteer for Long-Range Patrol units. Ranger Lesley volunteered to serve with Company C (Ranger), 75th Infantry (Airborne) and was transferred to the companies rear area in An Khe, the central highlands of the Republic of Vietnam. New recruits to Company C were required to complete an intensive 4-week training program that stressed the physical fitness and patrol operational procedures. Ranger Lesley excelled in all phases of the program and upon completion was sent forward for assignment as a team leader to a six-man Ranger patrol. Company C was in a high state of operational readiness and fielded 26 six-man teams. Ranger Lesley assumed leadership of Teams 1-6 after a very brief orientation period, completing 44 missions in his first year. After being promoted to Staff Sergeant in January 1970, Ranger Lesley requested an extension of his Vietnam service and immediately began to recruit and develop a cadre of senior scouts. Following leave to CONUS, Ranger Lesley returned to Vietnam in July 1970, and implemented training techniques that greatly increased the effectiveness of Company C Rangers and reduced the level of killed-in-action and wounded-in-action of those who completed the four week in country training. In addition to training new Company C recruits, Ranger Lesley provided training to the Republic of Korea White Horse Division, and returned to the forward area as a team leader for a short period during Company C’s incursion into Cambodia. By the end of his Vietnam service, Ranger Lesley had become a respected and valuable asset to Company C (Ranger), 75th Infantry (Airborne), and embodied the prestige, honor, and high “esprit de corps” of a Ranger noncommissioned officer. Although Huntington’s disease shortened career in 1995, his service reflects a consistent pattern of excellence and leadership. Throughout his military career Ranger Lesley has set the example for others to follow, clearly exemplifying that, “Rangers Lead the Way!”</citation>

Upon graduation from Duquesne University in 1964, Colonel Marm enlisted in the Army. He completed Infantry Officer Candidate School; and the Ranger Course in 1965. He was assigned to Company A, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). While serving as a platoon leader, Colonel Marm (then 2d Lieutenant) demonstrated indomitable courage during a combat operation on November 14, 1965 in the vicinity of La Drang Valley, Republic of Vietnam. His company was moving through the valley to relieve a friendly unit surrounded by an enemy force of estimated regimental size. Colonel Marm led his platoon through withering fire until they were finally forced to take cover. Realizing that his platoon could not hold very long and seeing four enemy soldiers moving into his position he moved quickly under fire and annihilated all four. Then seeing that his platoon was receiving intense fire from a concealed machinegun, he deliberately exposed himself to draw its fire. When he located its position, he attempted to destroy it with an antitank weapon. Although he inflicted casualties the weapon did not silence the enemy fire. Quickly disregarding the intense fire on him and his platoon, he charged thirty meters across open ground and hurled grenades into the enemy positions killing some of the eight insurgents manning it. Although severely wounded when his grenades were expended and armed only with a rifle, he continued the momentum of his assault on the positions and killed the remainder of the enemy. Colonel Marm’s selfless actions reduced the fire on his platoon, broke the enemy assault, and rallied his unit to continue toward the accomplishment of the mission. For his valorous actions, President Lynden Johnson awarded Colonel Marm the Medal of Honor on December 19, 1966. Colonel Marm’s gallantry on the battlefield and his extraordinary intrepidity at the risk of his life are in the highest traditions of the United Sates Army, and personify the spirit of the Ranger Creed. “Rangers Lead the Way”.</citation>

   <citation>Major William Spies is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for outstanding service as a Ranger throughout his military career. He served as an instructor in the 3d Army Noncommissioned Officer Academy and was later selected and graduated from Officer Candidate School. As a young airborne officer, his platoon was attached to the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry for Operation Checkmate in 1961. After a tour as a rifle company commander, Major Spies was selected as commandant, 7th Infantry Division Counter-Guerilla Warfare School in Korea. In Vietnam, Major Spies was assigned as senior advisor of the 2d ARVN Division Reconnaissance Company. This unit operated separately and in coordination with the 1st Marine Reconnaissance Battalion to conduct: point and area reconnaissance, bomb damage assessment, trail watching, ambushes, TPQ-10 strikes and adjustment of artillery, air and naval gunfire. During these operations he was wounded twice – 13 April and 29 June 1966. Despite his wounds, he continues to direct fire against the PAVN force. So serious were his wounds that he was evacuated first to Chu Lai, then to Walter Reed Army Hospital where his right foot and lower leg were amputated in March 1967. In the hospital and later in ranger assignments, Major Spies was an inspiration to soldiers, students, and rangers. He recovered and returned to "Lead the Way" by passing PT tests, completing 25 mile road marches, grading patrols, and making parachute jumps into unimproved drop zones. In addition to serving as the Ranger Department S-3, Chief of Benning Ranger Division, and Deputy Assisting Director, Major Spies worked with Sergeant Major James Collier to develop the table and organization and equipment, and devise doctrine for the soon-to-be 1st Ranger Battalion. He helped develop the concept of a Desert Phase into the Ranger Course. Major Spies’ superb leadership and exemplary service to the nation throughout his military career deserves the very special recognition of induction into the Ranger Hall of Fame.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel Robert A. "Tex" Turner is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his dedication to duty and contributions to the U.S. Army as a distinguished Ranger Leader. Colonel Turner embarked on a career that was marked with a unique balance of professional Army virtues: charismatic leadership, red-blooded patriotism, unerring performance and unfailing mission accomplishment. He started his 31 year military career as a platoon leader in Co A, 2nd Battalion, 509th ABN Infantry Battle Group in Germany. He was reassigned to Vietnam as a battalion advisor to the 35th Vietnamese Ranger Battalion. Returning back to the states he was assigned as the Deputy Chief of the Patrolling Committee, Ranger Department. It was upon his second tour of duty in Vietnam that Colonel Turner personified "Never Shall I Fail My Comrades…". Colonel Turner was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on 6 May, 1970 while serving as a member of a command group during the defense of Fire Support Base Henderson. Despite the intense mortar fire, Colonel Turner landed at the firebase and moved from position to position assessing the damage and directing the defense of the firebase. He left the firebase to return with badly needed medical supplies and with no regard to his personal safety, leapt from the hovering aircraft and began personally unloading the supplies despite intense mortar fire raining all around him. Though seriously wounded by an impacting mortar round, Colonel Turner administered first aid and again, subjecting himself to the hostile fire, carried a wounded soldier out to the landing pad for medical evacuation. Colonel Turners most significant impact to the Ranger community came while he served as the Director of the Ranger Department from 1982-1985. He created the Desert Phase of Ranger School and oversaw the critical combat task of live fire exercises being incorporated into Ranger School. Colonel Turner and MG Leuer saw the necessity in the upcoming world threat to start the Desert Phase of Ranger School in 1983, for over 12 years, 132 Ranger Classes and 20,000 Rangers gained valuable combat training through desert instruction and live fire exercises. Since his retirement in 1990, Colonel Turner has maintained his passion for training Rangers through his motivational speaking engagements at the U.S. Military Academy and as an advisor to the 43rd Virginia Volunteer Search and Rescue Company. His legendary career reflects great credit upon himself; past, present, and future Rangers; and the United States Army.</citation>

In October 1963 CPT Rocky Versace was a U.S. Army MAAG intelligence advisor assigned to support Province forces (Civil Guard and Self Defense Forces) operating in An Xuyen Province (IV Corps) in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam. On October 29, CPT Versace made a liaison visit to the Special Forces team A-23 camp at Tan Phu to exchange intelligence reports on enemy activities in the area. A determination was made to launch an attack against VC forces in the area. Captain Versace accompanied the attacking CIDG force with Special Forces Team members 1st LT Nick Rowe and SFC Dan Pitzer. Captain Versace was seriously wounded while helping to cove the withdrawal of CIDG forces in the face of a determined and very heavy Viet Cong Main Force attack. At the point CPT Versace, LT Rowe, and SFC Pitzer as well as the CIDG forces were almost out of ammunition. Captain Versace had seven rounds left in his carbine and was about to charge the Viet Cong in one last valiant effort to stop there pursuit when he was wounded. Lieutenant Rowe and SFC Pitzer were also wounded and all three captured buy the Viet Cong. Though suffering from a badly wounded and infected leg, and barely able to see when his glasses were taken from him, CPT Versace assumed the position of Senior American Prisoner and demanded that the Viet Cong treat the American prisoners in accordance to Geneva Convention protections. He protested \vehemently when the VC cadre refused to recognize them as "prisoners of war" but treated them instead as "war criminals", subject to the whims of individual cadre to decide matters of life and death. For his vociferous protestations against their barbarous and sub-human treatment, CPT Versace was placed in a locked isolation box and brutally treated and tortured. Captain Versace willingly sacrificed his life by focusing all the anger of the VC cadre on him instead of LT Rowe and SFC Pitzer so that they might have a better chance to survive. He refused to violate the Code of Conduct and lived the tenets of the Ranger Creed. Captain Versace told his captors that he was willing to accept death rather than compromise the Code of Conduct and the ideas of Duty, Honor, and Country. his unshakeable belief in God sustained him throughout his 2-year captivity until his death,. Captain Versace demonstrated those qualities and attributes essential for Ranger Hall of Fame selection.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Albert E. Atkins is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his dedication to duty and his contributions to the United States Army as a courageous and dynamic Ranger leader. Ranger Albert Atkins performed above and beyond the call of duty in every aspect of his 23-year military career. He saw combat during two wars—World War II and the Korean War. Ranger Atkins was a member of the 2nd Infantry Division during World War II and was in continuous battle since landing in Normandy in June 1944. He fought through France, the Hurtgen Forest, and was on the Eifel and Elsenborn Ridge in the Ardennes, Belgium during the early days of what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. He was well into Germany when the war ended in Europe. As a “high point” man he was transferred to the 99th Infantry for return to the United States and subsequent discharge on 7 August 1945. During the Korean War Ranger Atkins was a squad leader in the 4th Ranger Company. On 23 March 1951, Ranger Atkins participated in a combat parachute jump when the Rangers supported the 187th Parachute Infantry Regimental Combat Team at Munsanni. Ranger Atkins was one of the leaders that paddled their way across a mile of Hwachon reservoir water in the early morning hours of 11 April 1951 to take the fight to the Chinese guarding the dam on the reservoir. This was the only amphibious operation by any of the Korean War Airborne Ranger Companies. That evening nearly single-handedly, Ranger Atkins covered the withdrawal of the 4th Ranger Company from the line of engagement down the reverse slope to the water line, and across the reservoir to the point of embarkation. Ranger Atkins continued his service to his country until retirement relieved him of the responsibilities of a combat infantryman, but never as a Ranger. Ranger Atkins died on 26 May 1999.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Robert J. Geer distinguished himself during combat action during the Korean War while serving as a member of the 1st Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne). On 13-15 February 1951, Chinese communist forces completely surrounded the communications hub located at Chip Yong Ni, Korea. The 23rd Regimental Combat Team, with the 1st Ranger Infantry Company in RCT Reserve, surrounded by a numerically superior Chinese force set up their defensive position around Chip Yong Ni. The RCT dug in and held against continuous day and night human wave attacks. At approximately midnight, 14-15 February, the perimeter was breached as two rifle companies of the 2nd Battalion were overrun by Chinese forces. The RCT Commander, unwilling to commit his entire reserve ordered one platoon of Rangers to retake the lost position. The platoon leader was killed in action. The Rangers continued their vigorous attack against heavy automatic weapons, grenade and mortar fire. The left flank was pinned down as both enemy and friendly support fire rained in. As the platoon sergeant and both remaining squad leaders were wounded in action, SGT Geer assumed command and continued the attack. The few surviving Rangers drove the enemy from the hill killing many in the process. As SGT Geer was organizing a defense an enemy grenade exploded near his face and tore out his left eye. His weapon was also destroyed by the blast. Now blind in one eye with vision in the remaining eye blurred, he took up a BAR and continued to deliver devastating fire upon the enemy. By now all but one of his small force were dead or wounded. Under SGT Geer’s direction the living continued to deliver fire on the enemy. As their ammunition was expended, SGT Geer ordered the few survivors off the hill. He covered their withdrawal until his own ammunition was expended. Sergeant Geer then assisted his wounded brother off the hill. Still under aimed enemy fire SGT Geer’s brother was killed, hit again by a round through the heart. Without SGT Geer’s determination and leadership the enemy would have penetrated the RCT perimeter. Ranger Geer by his actions “saved the day that night”. “I will continue the mission though I be the lone survivor”.</citation>

As a platoon leader he repeatedly risked his life rallying his men to stand off repeated Banzai attacks. At the Battle of Nhpum Ga, while the Marauders were surrounded for two weeks, at one time he pulled his men back 100 yards, booby trapped their former foxholes, and strategically positioned his men so that when the enemy attacked, they were completely surprised. After repeated attacks by the enemy and fierce hand-to-hand engagements, the Japanese retreated leaving over 50 bodies behind. After this action, the Marauders nicknamed it McLogan’s Hill in his honor. Prior to volunteering for a dangerous and hazardous mission behind enemy lines with the Marauders, Lieutenant McLogan served with the 35th Infantry Regiment in battles in the South Pacific at Guadalcanal and his platoon was selected to lead the way in the first wave of the invasion of the Soloman Islands at the Beach Head.

Also for his distinguished duty as a Ranger instructor. During his three assignments with the Mountain Ranger Committee, MSG Minatra’s tactical knowledge, initiative, and high standards coupled with an unswerving desire to train and produce the best possible soldier was invaluable to the Ranger Department. In 1964-65, he served as a Ranger Advisor to the Vietnamese 11th Ranger Battalion; In 1967-68, he was an Airborne Advisor to the Vietnamese Airborne Division, and in 1971-72, he served a third voluntary tour with IV Corps Headquarters. In Vietnam he was cited several times for valor in combat with U.S. and Vietnamese awards, and the Purple Heart. On One occasion he moved through the hail of incoming mortar fire to carry a radioman to a protected position and under fire evacuated the other wounded men. His extraordinary heroism was instrumental in the defeat of a large enemy force during 17-19 November 1967, in an attack on Hill 1416 near Dak To, South Vietnam. As the advisor with a Vietnamese Airborne Battalion, he rallied the remainder of the unit after the initial assault in which the Vietnamese commander was wounded and disabled. After being wounded in a mortar barrage (he refused medical evacuation), and without regard for his safety, Sergeant Minatra moved to the point of heaviest contact and directed close air support against the attackers; At one point the bombs and napalm fell only 30 meters from his own position. He charged the enemy positions alone, killing a number of them and causing others to flee. The weary paratroopers inspired by his actions charged up the hill and completely overpowered the enemy force. For his unsurpassed heroism during this period of intense combat, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Master Sergeant Minatra is an inspirational model for all soldiers. He was, and is an outstanding example of “Rangers Lead The Way”.</citation>

   <citation>The Honorable Ronald E. Ray, former Assistant Secretary of Veteran Affairs, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his exceptional valor and dedicated service to the nation and the United States Army. Mr. Ray completed the Ranger Course in June 1964 and was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 509th Airborne. In 1966 while serving as platoon leader with Company A, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, he displayed extraordinary leadership as a combat leader. When an estimated reinforced Viet Cong company attacked one of his ambush patrols on June 19, 1966, Mr. Ray organized a reaction force and quickly moved through 2 kilometers of mountainous jungle terrain to the contact area. After breaking through the hostile lines to reach the patrol, Mr. Ray began directing the reinforcement of the site. When an enemy position pinned down three of his men with a heavy volume of automatic weapons fire, he silenced the emplacement with a grenade and killed four Viet Cong with his rifle. As medics were moving a casualty toward a sheltered position they began receiving intense hostile fire. While directing suppressive fire on the enemy position Mr. Ray moved close enough to silence the enemy with a grenade. A few moments later Mr. Ray saw an enemy grenade land, unnoticed, near two of his men. Without hesitation or regard for his safety he dove between the grenade and the men, shielding them from the explosion while receiving wounds in his exposed feet and legs. He immediately sustained additional wounds in his legs from an enemy machine gun, but nonetheless he silenced the emplacement with another grenade. Although bleeding profusely and suffering from excruciating pain, Mr. Ray displayed outstanding courage and presence of mind to continue to direct his men providing the outstanding courage and leadership they vitally needed to prevent their annihilation. Only after assuring that his platoon was no longer in immediate danger did he allow himself to be evacuated for medical treatment. Mr. Ray’s gallantry on the battlefield and his extraordinary intrepidity at the risk of his life personify the Ranger Creed, “I will never leave a fallen comrade”.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Richard O. Stewart, Jr. is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for epitomizing the Ranger Motto, “Rangers Lead the Way!” On 9 December 1969 while serving as the Combined Reconnaissance and Intelligence Platoon Leader for 1-5(Mechanized), 25th Infantry Division, 1LT Stewart’s platoon found itself in a heavily booby-trapped area. With disregard for his own safety, 1LT Stewart took over duties as the point man in an effort to safely lead his men out of the area. While on point he struck a booby-trapped 105mm shell that cost him both of his legs and his left eardrum. His selfless service and personal courage define what a Ranger leader should be. Although he received no cheers or parades when he returned from Vietnam, he lead the way in cheering on younger veterans—especially Ranger veterans—as they returned from combat actions and peacetime deployments. He has always given 100% and then some to the Ranger community. He influenced generations of Ranger Battalion S5’s among other Rangers so that they were aware of unit histories and aware of the heroic contributions of Ranger veterans. He has been recognized by several generations of Rangers performing this service.† Ranger Stewart has clearly led the way as a Ranger in combat and in supporting Rangers in its aftermath. He is a warrior leader whose dedicated service, positive attitude, and personal courage is an inspiration to all.† His contributions to Rangers will be felt for generations to come.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Robert L. Carr is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for valorous service to his country while with Merrill’s Marauders in Burma. He volunteered for the Marauders as a muleskinner in a pack artillery unit waiting in Australia to take part in the New Guinea fighting. While in Burma, Japanese forces trapped a Marauder battalion and under severe attack for several days, two 75-millimeter artillery pieces were parachuted in to aid the rescue units. Sergeant Carr volunteered with other former muleskinners to assemble and man the guns. He then volunteered to leave his position as a lead scout in an infantry platoon to serve as forward artillery, two of his fellow infantrymen were wounded. Sergeant Carr left his radio to drag each of the wounded through heavy fire to an aid man. Then he crawled forward throwing grenades toward Japanese lines to draw fire upon him so as to expose enemy positions and radioed back range and azimuth data for establishing fire. At that point, SGT Carr radioed, “Move in 10 yards and if you don’t hear from me, you’ll know I got too close”.† Instead, Marauder shells wiped out an enemy heavy machine gun nest only 30 yards away from him, and were able to dig the enemy out of their holes all across a hill that had been their strong point. Marauder soldiers then drove through to free the trapped Marauder unit after a 10-day blockade that had exacted heavy American casualties forcing Japanese forces to beat a broad retreat. Sergeant Carr returned as a lead scout with the Marauders until their closing battle at Myitkyina, where he was evacuated with scrub typhus requiring a long hospitalization. Two officers told him they had put him in for a Silver Star for his role in effecting the breakthrough. But a mule carrying the records fell off a cliff en route over a 5,800-foot high mountain range to Myitkyina and all records were lost. When he was discharged after World War II, SGT Carr worked in a steel mill, then as a passenger boat captain, and in heavy construction, rising in 30 years to supervisor of major projects and retirement as a company vice president. Sergeant Carr’s determination and remarkable bravery in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds exemplify the Rangers’ resolve to complete the mission.</citation>

   <citation>Staff Sergeant Glenn H. English, JR., is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his dedication to duty, devotion to his fellow soldiers and his unselfish sacrifice of his own life on the field of battle. On September 7, 1970, in the Phu My district of Vietnam while assigned to Company E, 3rd Battalion, 503 Infantry of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, Staff Sergeant English was riding in the lead armored personnel carrier when an enemy mine exploded in front of his vehicle. From a concealed position the enemy immediately opened up with automatic weapons and antitank grenades striking his vehicle and the rest of the convoy. Staff Sergeant English escaped from the disabled vehicle and without pausing to extinguish the flames of his clothing, rallied his stunned unit. Gallantly he led his troops in a vigorous assault, in the face of heavy enemy automatic weapons fire on the entrenched enemy position. This prompt and courageous action routed the enemy and saved his unit from destruction. Following the assault, SSG English heard the cries of 3 of his men who were still trapped in the burning vehicle. Paying no heed to warnings that the ammunition and fuel in the burning personnel carrier was about to explode, SSG English raced to the vehicle and climbed inside to rescue his wounded men. As he lifted one of the men to safety, the vehicle exploded, mortally wounding him and the man he was attempting to save. By his extraordinary devotion to duty, indomitable courage, and utter disregard for his own safety, SSG English saved his unit from destruction and selflessly sacrificed his life while living the Ranger Creed, “I will never leave a fallen comrade”. Staff Sergeant English’s conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the cost of his own life were an inspiration to his comrades and are in the highest traditions of the United States Army.</citation>

He began his service in 1973 when he was commissioned as an Infantry officer upon graduation from the ROTC Program at the University of Arkansas. Lieutenant Colonel Stauss was the 75th Ranger Regimental Executive Officer during Operation Just Cause. As the Regimental Executive Officer his responsibilities included deploying and operating the Regimental TOC to provide command and control for two simultaneous combat parachute assault airfield seizure operations. He was instrumental in coordinating relief in place efforts with the 82nd Airborne Division, and the 7th Infantry Division (Light) forces that followed Rangers into the theater of operations.† Throughout the deployment he led the Regimental staff in developing fragmentary orders for approximately 15 follow-on Ranger operations. As the 1st Ranger Battalion Commander, LTC Stauss deployed the Battalion to Kuwait as part of Operation Iris Gold – an emergency deployment operation designed to demonstrate U.S. resolve and commitment to the region, our allies and Iraqi forces in the wake of the Persian Gulf War.† As part of this Operation, the Battalion and elements of the Regimental Headquarters conducted a strategic deployment and parachuted into Ali Al Salem Airfield, conducted an extensive overland movement and culminated with a battalion live fire exercise. The deployment was a broad success, accomplished all goals, and set the tone for Iris Gold as an annual exercise in the Central Command area of responsibility. During his tenure in command he was a strong force in initiating a number of construction projects which serve Rangers today. These include covered rigging facilities, a new motor pool, and a shoot house and Ranger demolition area. He is buried at the National Cemetery at Fort Smith Arkansas—very near the final resting-place of William O. Darby. Lieutenant Colonel Stauss’ selfless service and leadership remains a model for today’s Rangers. It is appropriate that we recognize this great American for his service to the nation and the 75th Ranger Regiment.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Major Dennis L. Thompson is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his unfailing devotion to duty, and valorous actions against an armed enemy of the United States. On March 27, 1966, the Sergeant Thompson was advising a Vietnamese platoon when it was ambushed and pinned down by a numerically superior enemy force. He dismounted a truck-mounted machine gun and placed effective fire on the enemy positions. Inspired by his actions, the platoon placed a heavy volume of fire on the enemy and withdrew safely with their wounded from the enemy controlled area. On February 6, 1968, SSG Thompson was assigned to the Lang Vei Special Forces Camp when it came under a massive enemy armor and infantry attack. He closed to point blank range and destroyed one of the tanks with light antitank weapons. The next day SSG Thompson was calling helicopters to evacuate surviving camp defenders when a large enemy force confronted him. Realizing the impending danger to the helicopters, he waved them off and attempted to call air strikes on his position. After a hand-to-hand encounter with the enemy, SSG Thompson was rendered unconscious and taken prisoner. Later in an enemy prison camp, he and a fellow noncommissioned officer from Camp Lang Vei planned and executed an escape. His companion was unable to move quickly due to open wounds in his legs. After walking for days they were in sight of Camp Lang Vei when they were spotted by enemy troops.† Staff Sergeant Thompson’s companion told him to escape into the jungle alone. Knowing that he would have to assist his comrade in keeping up with the enemy or they would kill him, Staff Sergeant refused to leave his wounded comrade. This resulted in SSG Thompson becoming a prisoner of war for five more years. Staff Sergeant Thompson continuously resisted his captor’s efforts to force him to break the Code of Conduct by writing anti-American statements. He encouraged other American prisoners to resist also, and as a result spent almost 3 years in solitary confinement while his captors attempted to beat and starve him into submission. After returning to the United States, SGM Thompson completed Ranger School and served as a First Sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. Although it had not been written at the time, SGM Thompson surely lived every word of the Ranger Creed while confronting the enemy.</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Victor Valeriano is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for exceptional valor during participation in armed conflict. In numerous encounters with the enemy from December 1966 through January 1968, and in particular, on January 20, 1968, Sergeant Valeriano displayed uncommon courage and outstanding leadership qualities. While leading a 6-man LRRP unit in Thien Phouc on January 20, 1968, Sergeant Valeriano and his men came under a withering crossfire from a superior enemy force which quickly resulted in every member of the team being wounded, with three ultimately dying from their wounds. Unable to withdraw his team due to the crossfire, Sergeant Valeriano, though wounded himself and the only remaining effective fighting element f his team mounted a defense of his team’s position, successfully repelling both a frontal and flanking assault. During the ensuing firefight Sergeant Valeriano returned a number of enemy grenades thrown into his position. His tenacious defense of his team’s position eventually caused the enemy element to withdraw. Sergeant Valeriano’s courageous actions and steadfast commitment to his team saved the lives of the three remaining members. His conduct reflects the highest standards of the Ranger tradition.</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel Richard D. Wandke is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for exceptional valor and unwavering dedication to duty during his distinguished 25-year career. Upon graduating as a distinguished military student from the University of Maine in 1963, 2nd Lieutenant Wandke completed Ranger School and was assigned as a platoon leader for the 4th Infantry Division. He volunteered for duty in Vietnam and in 1965 was assigned as an advisor to the 43rd Vietnamese Ranger Battalion. He was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart for actions against the Viet Cong. He returned to Vietnam in 1969 after teaching ROTC at the University of Michigan. During his second tour, he commanded two different rifle companies and a LRRP unit. While in command of Company C, 1/12th Infantry Battalion, 4th Infantry Division, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for leading his company in a search and destroy mission. Though wounded, he was able to keep his company in contact with a superior force for 13 hours. As darkness fell he ordered all who were mobile to establish a landing zone to evacuate the wounded. He alone stayed to protect the dead and wounded. Although his company of 88 soldiers sustained heavy casualties (six KIA and forty-four WIA) his company is credited with killing over 300 enemy personnel. His career assignments have ranged from platoon to Army level. Lieutenant Colonel Wandke retired from active service in 1988 and has since been teaching high school ROTC. He belongs to several veteran organizations and was the National Commander of the Legion of Valor from 1995 – 1996. Throughout his military career he has been a teacher, a mentor, and a soldier. His personal and professional actions have been in accordance with those of the Ranger Creed.</citation>

   <citation>Command Sergeant Major (Ret) Acebes is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his 30-year career as a Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) in the U.S. Army. He began his career as a paratrooper in the 173d Airborne Brigade in Vietnam, fighting numerous engagements. He also served his country overseas in the Berlin Brigade during the height of the Cold War. When CSM(R) Acebes eventually returned to the United States, he served in the 82d Airborne Division as a team leader and then a squad leader, using his already vast knowledge to train paratroopers. He decided to further hone his war-fighting skills by attending U.S. Army Ranger School in November 1972. CSM(R) Acebes volunteered for Ranger duty with 1st Ranger Battalion at its inception in 1974. He initially served as part of the original cadre that trained the Battalion to become the elite modern-day Ranger force that continues to uphold the highest standards today. CSM(R) Acebes dedicated himself to training the new Ranger Battalion so it would be ready for anything the country might call it to do. He held every NCO leadership position, from squad leader and platoon sergeant to company first sergeant during his first tour in the 1st Ranger Battalion. CSM(R) Acebes left the 1st Ranger Battalion to attend the SF Qualification Course and was assigned to 10th Special Forces Group in Germany. There, he continued training soldiers in accordance with the Abrams Charter, bringing what he learned in the Rangers to the rest of the Army. However, CSM(R) Acebes couldn’t stay away from his Rangers long and returned to 1st Ranger Battalion as Charlie Company’s First Sergeant where he prepared, led, and brought his company home from Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada. He left the Battalion only to return to the Rangers three years later as the Regimental Chief Intelligence NCO at Regimental Headquarters. CSM(R) Acebes finally returned to 1st Ranger Battalion in 1988 to serve as the Command Sergeant Major and lead Rangers once again. When he left the battalion, it would be for the last time, but he continued to make a difference in the Army as the CSM of the 2d Infantry Division and finally as the CSM of the U.S. Army Infantry School. CSM(R) Acebes lived the Ranger Creed every day of his career and dedicated his life to training and leading Rangers. He continues to be an outstanding role model for all Rangers to emulate. CSM(R) Acebes’ career brings great credit upon him, the 1st Ranger Battalion, and the U.S. Army.</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel Melvin R. Blair is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for displaying exceptional valor in two wars. He enlisted in the Army in 1934 and served in the 13th Horse Cavalry Regiment at Fort Riley, Kansas, until assigned to the Cavalry ROTC unit at Norwich University, Northfield, Vermont. In 1942, he was commissioned upon his graduation and served as a platoon commander in the 10th Horse Cavalry Regiment at Camp Lockett, California. In World War II, he volunteered for Merrill’s Marauders and, upon arrival in Burma, was assigned as a reconnaissance platoon leader in the 209th Combat Engineers. When a patrol under his leadership was pinned down by machine gun fire, he crawled alone to the rear of the enemy position and killed the gun crew with his carbine. Three days later, when two members of his patrol were wounded, he crawled out under heavy enemy fire and brought them back. He earned a battlefield promotion to captain and was appointed the Executive Officer of the 3rd Squadron, 124th Cavalry Regiment. Shortly thereafter, he was wounded by enemy action but rejoined his unit in China. Following World War II, he attended the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Armor School, Fort Knox, Kentucky; and the G-2 course at Fort Leavenworth. He was then assigned to the G-2 staff in General Headquarters, Tokyo. During the Korean War, he served as a battalion commander in the 25th Infantry Division. After one of his companies lost all but one officer to enemy fire, he took over. He led one platoon in a successful counter-attack; organized a perimeter defense with 50 men; and inspired them by word and deed to hold the position, despite four Banzai attacks by more than 400 enemy soldiers. With ammunition running out, he ordered the withdrawal of his unit while personally guarding its rear with six men. Although wounded, he remained until sure that the main body and other wounded were able to withdraw safely. After his recovery, he held assignments in the Pentagon, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning and retired from military service in 1954. For extraordinary heroism in two wars, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with Oak Leaf Cluster; the Silver Star; the Bronze Star, with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters; the Purple Heart, with two Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge with Star.</citation>

   <citation>Undersecretary of the Army Les Brownlee is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his dedication to duty, selfless service, and commitment to the United States Army. Mr. Brownlee began his service as an infantryman by graduating as the United States Army Ranger School Distinguished Honor Graduate in January, 1965. Shortly thereafter, Undersecretary Brownlee took command of the Bravo Company Bulls from 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment. The 503rd was part of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the first major ground unit to enter Vietnam. On 2 January 1966, while serving as a company commander during a combat mission in the Plain of Reeds, Captain Brownlee was moving his company into an assault formation to secure a landing zone, when the company began to receive intense Viet Cong fire. Skillfully maneuvering his company to less exposed positions that offered better fields of fire, Captain Brownlee directed suppressive retaliatory fire. With complete disregard for his own safety, Captain Brownlee moved his command post dangerously close to the center of conflict to better control the movement of his troops. While being continuously exposed to enemy fire, Captain Brownlee ensured the success of the mission by personally controlling the air and artillery strikes on the determined Viet Cong forces. When a bomb inadvertently dropped on his left flank platoon, Captain Brownlee led his men in an attack and completely overran several heavily fortified Viet Cong positions. Captain Brownlee’s extraordinary heroism in close combat against a numerically superior hostile force was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army Rangers and resulted in the awarding of Captain Brownlee’s first Silver Star. His subsequent actions and leadership while serving in the 503rd clearly went above and beyond the call of duty, and as a result, CPT Brownlee was awarded two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and the Purple Heart for his actions in Vietnam.
Later, Mr. Brownlee went on to command a mechanized infantry battalion in the 3rd Infantry Division in Germany. In his final job as an Army officer, then Colonel Brownlee served as the Military Executive to the Undersecretary of the Army, James Ambrose. His service did not end with retirement. In 1987, Mr. Brownlee served on the Republican Staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, under both Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator John Warner. From late 1987 until 1996, Mr. Brownlee was the Principal Senate Armed Service Committee Professional Staff Member, responsible for Army and Marine Corps’ programs, Special Operations programs, and drug interdiction policy and support. In addition, as Deputy Director, Mr. Brownlee was heavily involved in policies and programs relating to missile defense, strategic deterrence and Naval strategy, shipbuilding, and weapons programs. In March, 1996, Mr. Brownlee was named Staff Director of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, a position he maintained through the change of control in the Senate in 2000. Mr. Les Brownlee was named the 27th Undersecretary of the Army on 14 November 2001. Mr. Brownlee has chosen and succeeded in the most demanding of professions and continues to give one hundred percent and then some to his country.</citation>

Mr. Callaway earned his commission from the United States Military Academy with the class of 1949. Following training as an Infantry Officer, he was assigned to the 17th Infantry and saw combat in Korea as a platoon leader. He was awarded the Combat Infantry Badge, three Campaign Ribbons, and the Republic of Korea Unit Citation. Following a distinguished career in the private sector, he was appointed Secretary of the Army in 1973. During his tenure in that high office, he took a personal interest in the activation of the 1st Battalion, 75th Rangers. Secretary Callaway visited the Ranger Battalion twice during its formation and early periods as a battalion to provide assistance as needed. In August, 1974, Secretary Callaway presided as the Reviewing Officer for the activation ceremony of the battalion and passed the colors to the Battalion Commander. Those present at the ceremony will long remember Secretary Callaway as he trooped the line and spoke individually to nearly every one of the Rangers in the ranks of the 650 Rangers standing in the formation. He told them how proud he was of their accomplishments and urged them to set the standards, resulting in the motto “RANGERS LEAD THE WAY.”</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Romeo John Castonguay is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his unfailing devotion to duty and his heroic service to the Nation.† During WWII, Master Sergeant Castonguay served with the 517th Parachute Infantry, 17th Airborne Division, participating in combat parachute assaults into southern France and fighting in three subsequent major campaigns. In 1950, MSG Castonguay volunteered for the newly activated Airborne Ranger companies. During training, he treated every situation as a “teachable moment.” After hours, he was available to give informal instruction. These sessions were wide ranging-- from weapons and map reading to infantry tactics—and his military knowledge was encyclopedic. He was instrumental in the high degree of combat readiness exhibited by the 1st Ranger Company when it entered combat in Korea.When the 1st Ranger Company was committed to combat, MSG Castonguay always stayed with his Rangers. Leaving others to do rear area duties, he would accompany most combat missions, recognizing where his presence could contribute the most.In early February, 1950, during the nighttime Chang Mal Raid, two Rangers were severely wounded during the approach march, and their squad was left behind for security and to find shelter for the wounded from the -25degree cold. After the mission, in which over 100 of the enemy were killed, Ranger Castonguay returned alone through enemy lines to locate the missing Rangers. As darkness fell, he managed to locate them and lead them safely back to friendly lines.On the morning of 15 February 1951, at Chip Yong Ni, during an attack to regain an over-run 23rd RCT position, all twenty-seven attacking Rangers were either killed or wounded. Without hesitation, Ranger Castonguay began to evacuate the wounded under murderous enemy fire. He suffered a severe wound to his stomach but continued to assist his fellow Rangers to safety. A second burst tore into his face. His now famous dying words were “they shot my ‘Gaw-damned beak off.”</citation>

   <citation>Brigadier General John T. Corley is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his dedication to duty, combat leadership, and heroic service to the nation during both World War II and Korea. Within 18 months of graduating West Point, General Corley demonstrated such extraordinary leadership abilities that he earned battlefield promotions while serving in every command assignment from platoon leader through battalion commander in the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division, in World War II. From fighting in Tunisia, to leading his battalion in the assaults on Sicily and Normandy, across France and Belgium, and into Germany, he earned every decoration for valor except the Medal of Honor.Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, LTC Corley was one of the twenty-one combat experienced Infantry commanders personally requested by the General of the Army, Douglas Mc Arthur. During the next seven months, he fought in the battle of the Pusan Perimeter, the breakout of Kunsan, the final drive toward the Yalu, the withdrawal south of Seoul, and the drive north toward the Han River. Due to General Corley’s vast combat leadership experience, he was selected to become the Director of the Ranger Department, United States Army Infantry School. General Corley’s ability to impart his leadership experience in combat operations greatly enhanced the quality of the Ranger Course and the leaders it produced for the Army. His career then turned towards positions of even greater responsibility as the Assistant Division Commander of the 2nd Infantry Division, where he displayed his ability to elicit the best performance form soldiers and from tactical units when he organized, trained, and deployed a brigade force. Later, as the Chief of Staff, First Army, General Corley consistently and effectively guided the staff through a difficult period of retrenchment, maintaining a high state of morale and effectiveness. General Corley culminated his brilliant career as the Deputy Commanding General, United States Army Training Center, Fort Jackson, South Carolina, where his extensive background and outstanding leadership ability were directed to the training of soldiers to meet the Army’s worldwide commitments.Throughout General Corley’s distinguished 28-year career he has “shouldered more than his share of the task whatever it may be, one hundred percent and then some.”</citation>

His aggressive and tireless efforts to be of service, coupled with a wholehearted devotion to duty, serve as an example for all Rangers.His nickname “Bull” reflected his approach to every task that came his way. Completing Ranger School in 1952, at the age of twenty, spear-headed his vast training and experience which was reflected in his actions in combat during one tour in Korea and three tours in Vietnam, earning him six Bronze Medals, with Oak Leaf clusters, and ten Air Medals, with Oak Leaf cluster.Living his life according to the Ranger Creed, Ranger Gergen, as a first sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry, 101st Airborne Brigade, near Phu Bai, Republic of Vietnam, distinguished himself through heroism against an enemy of undetermined size. On 17 April 1968, First Sergeant “Bull” Gergen was moving with Company B, when it began receiving a large volume of sniper fire. Immediately, First Sergeant Gergen began laying down a heavy volume of fire upon the enemy. When two men were wounded, he immediately ran forward through the heavy enemy fusillade to the aid of the wounded men. Upon reaching the men, he found one dead and the other seriously wounded. He began treating the wounded man after taking him to safety and continued treating him until a medical aid man arrived to take over. First Sergeant Gergen then returned to the battle area and began directing fields of fire to effectively engage the enemy, completely routing them.Throughout his twenty-four year military career, he charged forward, being promoted to Master Sergeant within two years of service and becoming the youngest Command Sergeant Major of his time. He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, with one Oak Leaf cluster, and the Legion of Merit.</citation>

Ranger Labrozzi’s career started in September, 1946, when he first enlisted in the Army. In May of 1950, he joined the Pennsylvania National Guard. In September, 1950, it was activated for the Korean War, and at that time, he volunteered for the Rangers and became the First Sergeant for the 12th Ranger Company. After the Rangers were deactivated in September, 1951, he joined the 187th Regimental Combat Team and went immediately to Korea. On 5 November 1952, he earned a battlefield commission to Second Lieutenant while 23000 meters in front of the main battle line. General Westmoreland, who was then the Commanding General of the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, came to his platoon and pinned the gold bars on him. While in Korea, Ranger Labrozzi earned the Korean Service Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge, and Presidential Unit Citation. When the conflict started in Vietnam, he volunteered to serve there and from the period of 10 November 1965 until 7 September 1970, he earned six Air Medals for heroism. He received each one for conducting 25 flights into enemy hot zones, picking up dead and wounded, and delivering supplies: that totals 150 flights in helicopters that the Viet Cong always tended to target. He earned four Bronze Stars from 26 January 1966 until 22 February 1970 for heroism. In one operation, while his unit was being re-supplied with ammo by helicopter, the helo dropped the ammo on a hot LZ. Major Labrozzi and three South Vietnamese soldiers ran out to get the ammo. All Vietnamese men were hit. Tony threw one over his shoulder, grabbed the other one by the collar, and dragged them back to safety, all the while under intense machine gun fire. He then went back and got the ammo and the other soldier. Besides the honors noted he also earned two Army Commendation Medals, both with Oak Leaf Clusters and the Soldiers Medal for heroism. Col. Labrozzi served 10 years in combat. Throughout Col. Labrozzi’s long 32-year career, he has distinguished himself in a manner that is a credit to the Airborne Rangers, the United States Army, and anyone who has ever had the honor to serve with him.</citation>

Captain Jim Lyle led units in four campaigns and in the three invasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, twice earning the right to wear Distinguished Unit Citation. Lyle was noted for quick and accurate assessments under fire and for aggressive leadership to achieve the mission, doing so with minimal casualties. During the crisis at Kasserine Pass, General Terry Allen made an urgent request to Lt. Col. Darby to send him a “ reinforced Ranger company with a hairy chested Company Commander with big _ _ _ _”. Captain Lyle’s C Company was sent.In March 1943, Captain Lyle displayed daring bravery in Tunisia at El Guettar when, during a massive German assault, a unit of the 18th Infantry Regiment was being overrun. Lyle’s company rescued it by attacking the enemy flank with cannon, stalling the enemy attack. In the Sicily invasion in July, 1943, Captain Lyle led two Ranger companies ashore to destroy enemy coastal guns before the main Allied force landed, for which he was awarded the Silver Star. Valor was not uncommon for Lyle. In postwar Germany, he risked his life to save two people from drowning, an act of heroism for which he was awarded the Soldier’s Medal. In the Korean conflict, in October, 1950, as the Executive Officer of the 2/187th Major Lyle was seriously injured, smashing both legs and hips, in a combat parachute and was declared Missing in Action.† After a long medical recovery, during which Lt. Col. Lyle demonstrated unimaginable courage, he commanded the 52nd AIB in Italy in 1957, and in 1961, he served as Senior Advisor to the 7th Republic of Korea Infantry Division. Lt. Col.

He saw combat with a small group of Americans handpicked as Advisors to the Vietnamese Rangers and Airborne during his three combat tours in South Vietnam. An honor graduate of the German Ranger School, and an original member of the V Corps’ Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Company, his military service spanned from postwar World War II, to the Cold War era, to the unconventional warfare operations of the Vietnam conflict.Among numerous highlights of his audacious service are a Combat Tactical parachute jump with the Vietnamese Airborne Division and a Commendation for his efforts in rescuing Americans and Vietnamese from the American Embassy in Saigon, after a Viet Cong bomb was detonated, killing two Americans 17 Vietnamese and wounding 51Americans and 94 Vietnamese. He was selected as the “first” Ranger class tactical NCO, with the U.S. Army Ranger Department/Florida Ranger Camp, under a new system that featured having both an officer and NCO to mentor and teach a student class. He was recommended for a battlefield commission, which he declined, and was awarded the American Spirit Honor Medal during his U.S. Marine Corps’ basic training for displaying “Outstanding Qualities of Leadership Best Expressing the American Spirit—Honor, Initiative, Loyalty and High Example to Comrades in Arms.” In recognition of his courage and high personal qualities while fighting with the Vietnamese 52nd Ranger Battalion, Ranger Markivich was designated as an enlisted aide to Brigadier General John K. Boles. Decorated by both the U.S. Military and the Vietnamese during each of his combat tours, Sergeant Major Markivich has exemplified the spirit of the American Ranger.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Mark Toschik is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his conspicuous heroic service to his country in time of war and for his devotion to the Ranger Creed in never leaving a fallen comrade behind. In March, 1970, 2nd Lt. Toschik volunteered for Ranger duty as platoon leader with 1st Platoon, Company E (Ranger), 75th Infantry, 3d Brigade, 9th Infantry Division in Tan An, Long An Province, Republic of Vietnam, engaging in combat operations against hostile forces in the Mekong Delta and in Cambodia. On 11 August 1970, 1st Lt. Mark Toschik was killed in action in Dinh Tuong Province, Republic of Vietnam and was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action and the National Order of Vietnam, Fifth Class. The circumstances leading to these awards are as follows: Ranger Toschik was flying Command and Control and had inserted Teams1-4. As the helicopter lifted off, it came under intense automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenade fire. Ranger Toschik moved to the left door to assist the door gunner in engaging three enemy soldiers firing from the ground. Although wounded twice, he continued to place highly accurate fire on enemy positions. The action was quick and fierce, and Ranger Toschik fought back savagely with all available resources. Having expended his 30 round magazine, he grabbed up and emptied the 20 round magazines of two additional M16 rifles. He was then wounded a third time as the helicopter received a direct hit from a Rocket Propelled Grenade round. Ranger Toschik now fired all the rounds of his 9mm and, to attest to the relative closeness of the encounter, he threw the empty pistol at the enemy. He then ripped the .38 cal. pistol from the copilot’s shoulder holster and emptied it before the helicopter hit the ground and burst into flames. Upon impact, Ranger Toschik, though mortally wounded, disregarded his own wounds and managed to pull the copilot and then moved to the far side of the craft in search of other wounded aircrew. Ranger Toschik could go no farther and succumbed to his wounds. Ranger Toschik’s conspicuous valor and unwavering dedication to his comrades, for whom he willingly and without reservation made the ultimate sacrifice, exemplifies the highest ideals if the Ranger Creed, “I WILL NEVER LEAVE A FALLEN COMRADE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.”</citation>

   <citation>Technical Sergeant John A. “Red” Acker is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for displaying courageous and skillful leadership at a critical point in Burma during World War II.  As a gunner in the 98th Field Artillery Battalion, serving in New Guinea, he joined fellow pack artillery men in answering President Roosevelt’s call for volunteers for a “dangerous and hazardous mission” with Merrill’s Marauders. When the unit went 
behind enemy lines in Burma, they had no artillery, so he was put in charge of pack animals for the Khaki Combat Team, Third Battalion.  He was responsible for distributing airdrops and transporting heavy weapons and equipment.  Midway through the campaign, a numerically superior Japanese force trapped the Marauder’s 2nd Battalion and subjected it to a prolonged siege. Other Marauder’s units made repeated efforts to 
break through but to no avail. Faced with punishing enemy artillery fire, Technical Sergeant Acker, and fellow artillery men turned muleskinners, saw an opportunity to silence the guns and rescue their comrades by getting artillery themselves. He pressed a superior officer for an airdrop of two 75mm pack artillery pieces, and received quick approval. Three days later, he received his guns, disassembled, by parachute. His crews quickly put these together.  Technical Sergeant Acker reconnoitered enemy positions at great personal risk and moved the guns on mules to position them for maximum effect, briefing an Infantryman to act as an observer. The new artillery soon zeroed in on the enemy guns, sending enemy bodies and gun parts into the air. His crews then fired hundreds of rounds into other strongpoints, exacting such heavy casualties as to cause the enemy to withdraw and allow the Marauders to end the siege after ten days.  Technical Sergeant Acker meanwhile took the risk of trading places with an aerial observer to direct fire upon the retreating enemy. His pilot in a Piper Cub l-5, failed to clear a hill, crashed, and was killed instantly. Seriously wounded himself, Technical Sergeant Acker fixed the broken radio to call for extraction. He was rescued by a ground patrol and flown out for hospitalization.  By his resourceful actions and his determined efforts to rescue his comrades, Technical Sergeant Acker exemplified the highest ideal of the Ranger Creed.</citation>

Ranger Bayne enlisted in May, 1947 and served with the 504th Parachute Infantry until he answered the call for volunteers to serve as Airborne Rangers in Korea. Ranger Bayne served two combat tours during the Korean War. His first combat tour was with the 1st 
Airborne Ranger Company, where they participated in many raids, ambushes, and four major campaigns. During his second combat tour, Ranger Bayne served with the 25th Infantry Division, participating in three major campaigns. He won a battlefield commission in 1952 while serving as an enlisted infantry platoon leader. After his combat tours in Korea, Ranger Bayne volunteered for, and served with, the 77th Special Forces. He served as both ODA Team XO and Commander. He volunteered for flight training and became a rated army aviator. During his first Vietnam tour, he commanded the MACV Flight Detachment. On his second tour in Vietnam he commanded Can-Tho Army Airfield, and C.A.C., Long-Than. During these tours he volunteered to fly night Mohawk OV-1 on radar and low-level infrared missions. Between combat tours in Vietnam, Ranger Bayne commanded Redstone Army Airfield, and served as Operations Officer for Hunter Army Airfield, where he was also responsible for 30 G.C.A. Sites. He has also served as a chairman of the instrument examining boards at Hunter Army Airfield, First U.S. Army, and Army Material Command.

   <citation>Staff Sergeant Harold G. Bennett is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary courage against numerically superior forces on the battlefields of South Vietnam, and for his conspicuous gallantry while held in captivity by the Viet-Cong. While serving as a Ranger Advisor to the 33rd Vietnamese Ranger Battalion, SSG Bennett volunteered, on Christmas Day, to lead a seven man Ranger combat team on a helicopter (named the “Suicide Chopper”) into a one-ship landing zone near the Cambodian border in an effort to free three Americans held captive by communist forces.  Ranger Bennett and his snatch team landed and quickly worked their way through the camp. The VC had moved the prisoners prior to their arrival. While this mission to liberate the captured Americans was not accomplished, in no way did it detract from the heroic efforts of SSGBennett to free them.  Four days later, on December 29th, 1964, SSG Bennett, with his American RTO, accompanied the 2nd Company of the 33rd Ranger Battalion on the first airlift into Operational Area of the Legendary “Battle of Binh Gia.” As the rangers were being overrun by elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division, SSG Bennett remained on the radio refusing any attempt to evacuate him and his RTO from the overwhelming enemy forces and their firepower.  After SSG Bennett’s capture at Binh Gia, he was labeled a troublemaker by his captors because of his constant aggressiveness in the brutal conditions of the jungle pow camps. He verbally berated his guards, daring them to confront him man-to-man. On one of his three unsuccessful escape attempts, a Viet Cong soldier almost bit off SSG Bennett’s finger as he punched the guard. Driven by dedication to duty, personal honor, and his religious faith, the enemy could not break him.  In June of 1965, the Communist National Liberation Front announced that they had executed SSG Harold G. Bennett, reportedly in reprisal for actions of the South Vietnamese government; he was the “first” American soldier to be executed in Vietnam. Ranger Bennett’s exemplary boldness, complete disregard for his own safety, and his deep concern for his fellow fighting men at the risk of his own life, reflects the highest traditions of the United States Army; his actions are the embodiment of the Ranger Spirit.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger (CW4) Charles W. Caruth entered the service from the great state of Texas and distinguished himself throughout his nearly 21-year military career with exceptionally meritorious and valorous service. Ranger Caruth was cited for gallantry in action and inspirational leadership during heavy fighting on Nori Outpost on July 6, 1952. He was personally credited with stopping a ferocious assault by the Chinese, protecting his platoon medic and wounded machine gun crew, reorganizing his men, routing the enemy, and retaking the outer trenches. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions. During the remainder of his service in Korea as platoon sergeant, he was cited for performing his duties in an outstanding manner. He gave his men instructions and assistance according to his combat experience in order to prepare them for unforeseen emergencies that might arise. For this he was awarded the Bronze Star (Meritorious). On his return to CONUS, Ranger Caruth was assigned to the Air Defense Center, Fort Bliss, Texas, where he continued to “lead the way,” while making a major career change from infantry to air defense. He attended the Nike Fire Control Maintenance Course – a 50-week highly technical course – and graduated 4th in a class of 60. He was named Air Defense Center NCO of the month for November, 1956 by the Commanding General. He was also named outstanding graduate for two transition courses he attended with grades of 98.5% And 96.39%. The Department of the Army formally recognized his value to the service by awarding the Meritorious Service Medal for the period of October 12, 1963 to August 30, 1968. The presentation was made at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, by U.S. Senator Joseph Montoya with a citation recognizing his unique leadership.  In all endeavors, he continued to display those traits 
of loyalty, professional competence, and sustained devotion to duty that reflects great credit upon himself and the United States Army.

He graduated from West Point in 1951, commissioned a 2LT in the Infantry.  In 1952, he was sent to Korea as a Rifle Platoon Leader in the 14th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division on Heartbreak Ridge. On October 9th, 1952, Lieutenant Gividen led a relief force to rescue an ambushed patrol from another platoon in his company. Moving through heavy small arms and mortar fire, he assisted the survivors to return to friendly lines. When one man was reported missing, Lieutenant Gividen led a patrol back to the ambush site through enemy fire to search for the missing man. For these heroic actions he was awarded the Silver Star. Three days later, on October 12th, 1952, he distinguished himself by extraordinary bravery in action against an enemy outpost that had been sending raiding parties against U.S. Forces.  In the ensuing firefight Lieutenant Gividen was wounded four times but wounded fifteen to twenty enemy soldiers. In spite of his wounds and loss of blood, he successfully led his patrol back to friendly lines bringing his wounded with him.  For this action he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.  Although he suffered the loss of a leg in this action, he was assigned to the Ranger Department in 1953, taught hand to hand combat, and was awarded the Ranger Tab for his outstanding service.  In 1957, while attending Vanderbilt University, he was awarded the Soldiers Medal for rescuing a drowning man by diving into a river after unstrapping his artificial leg. He was assigned to West Point for the next three years inspiring cadets with his outstanding leadership. He retired from the army in 1960, and worked as the Chief of the Army Research Field Unit at Fort Hood, Texas, until 1990. He also was a member of the City Council of Copperas Cove.

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel Gooch entered the Army as a Private in May, 1941. As a Staff Sergeant in 1944, he earned a battlefield commission. During a campaign in WWII, he alone, approached the German lines and asked to be led to their commander. There, he convinced the commander to surrender without a fight, precluding countless injuries and deaths. He was a humble and compassionate man but at the same time, he was a tough and demanding teacher. He led by example and it is said that he “loved people and used things, and he never reversed the two.” In May, 1945, First Lieutenant Gooch was severely wounded. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. He served in Korea in 1950 and 1951 and was awarded his second combat infantryman’s badge.  In 1958, he graduated from the Ranger course and then served as the Camp Commander, Mountain Ranger Camp.  Prior to his command, the students were living in pup tents in an area that was wet and muddy. He had GP medium tents with stoves erected.   He also had the airstrip constructed on Camp Merrill that is still in use today. Upon being assigned to Fort Benning, as Chief of the Combat Conditioning Committee, he introduced the Army to pugil stick training. His innovative thinking warranted his assignment as the Chief, Benning Phase of Ranger Training. He was instrumental in changing the training sequence of the students going from Benning to Florida. He selected a ten-mile square area of Fort Benning that was too rough for others to train in. He then outlined the plans for, and supervised the construction of a classroom, the squad planning bays,  the confidence course now famously known as the “Darby Queen”.  The area named Camp Darby, was in fact once labeled “Gooch’s Gulch” by the Ranger Cadre.  He was instrumental in developing a course where Rangers are trained to be leaders, trained in near-combat conditions, under strict light discipline, always camouflaged, and with no civilian vehicles in sight. He was a stickler about complete and detailed planning and precise rehearsals from the first walk-through to the final dress rehearsal. Final inspections were meticulous. He instituted the cadre led patrol, followed by the student led patrol.  Ranger Lieutenant Colonel Gooch was a consummate teacher, trainer, and leader who ensured that those who became Rangers during his watch were “more elite soldiers who move further, faster,” and would “fight harder than any other soldier.”</citation>

   <citation>In April 1951, the Chinese and North Koreans launched 350,000 troops in an all-out offensive to drive United Nations forces from Korea. The ferocious night attack broke the 6th Republic of Korea Division, routing it for 21 miles and leaving the right flank of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division exposed. Captain James A. Herbert, Commander of the 8th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne), led 89 Rangers into the void to determine the location and number of the enemy. In a long and arduous climb through the night, Captain Herbert led his men to a high mountaintop point of observation. As dawn broke, the Rangers could see what appeared to be rivers of Chinese flowing southward along the right flank of the 24th Infantry Division.  Captain Herbert informed his seniors of the situation by radio and began to call artillery fire and air strikes on the enemy. Now alerted to the danger, the 24th Infantry Division began to withdraw. Captain Herbert and his Rangers were now deep in Chinese-controlled territory.  Upon orders to return to U.S. Lines, Captain Herbert successfully bypassed the encroaching enemy units.  During their return to friendly lines, scouts reported a large Chinese force.  Though vastly outnumbered, Captain Herbert led the 8th Airborne Rangers in the attack. In the fierce battle that followed, the Chinese were hit hard and their attack on the 21st Infantry Regiment was prevented. A third of the Rangers received wounds, including Captain Herbert, who was shot through the throat, shoulder and arm. With their mission accomplished, the Rangers broke contact and brought their casualties to link-up with American armor. During this march, Ranger Herbert pushed his fingers into his wounded throat and walked over three-quarters of a mile to the awaiting tanks. The 24th Infantry Division Commander said of the Ranger attack, “by your action you have saved the 21st Infantry Regiment, if not the division”. Ranger Herbert was one of America’s first Airborne Rangers and a founding father of the Ranger Department at Fort Benning. Ranger Herbert also served nearly five years in Vietnam and played a major role in the defeat of North Vietnamese forces during the enemy TET campaign. His exemplary thirty years of army service is an inspiration to all Rangers.</citation>

Prior to his enlistment, he and his family were forcibly relocated from their home in Kent, Washington to a relocation center in Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. Even so, regardless of government opinion, Technical Sergeant Hirabayashi considered himself a patriotic American and enlisted in the Army prior to Pearl Harbor. Technical Sergeant Hirabayashi then volunteered to President Roosevelt’s request for men for a “dangerous and hazardous mission behind enemy lines.” For a period of seven months, he repeatedly operated under very adverse and dangerous conditions and was instrumental in the Marauders accomplishing their mission by intercepting and interpreting the Japanese Officers’ orders.  The information resulted in the ability of the Marauders to lay traps and inflict heavy casualties on the enemy, and capture the airfield at Mytkyiana.  After the Burma Campaign, while in China interrogating Japanese Prisoners of War, he learned that the Japanese were developing an atomic bomb.  After the war, he had a distinguished career in government service, including the State Department and at the Library of Congress.  He also served as translator and court monitor at the war crimes trial and the war crimes patrol board.

   <citation>Major James Gavin Storter is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his unfailing devotion to duty and valorous actions against the armed enemies of the United States.  On January 30th, 1966, then Sergeant First Class Storter was advising a Vietnamese Airborne Battalion when a nearby friendly unit became pinned down, in open rice paddies, by heavy mortar and automatic weapons fire.  Notified that two American advisors had been wounded and were missing, Sergeant First Class Storter immediately left his position, exposed himself to intensive enemy fire, and began searching the forward areas of the battlefield.  Locating one of the severely wounded men, Sergeant First Class Storter administered emergency medical treatment and carried his comrade through a heavy volume of enemy fire to a sheltered position.  
Disregarding his personal safety, Sergeant Storter again exposed himself to the enemy fire to search for the other wounded American until the injured man had been located.  On June 24th, 1969, then Captain Storter, lead a reconnaissance in force operation deep in enemy controlled territory to capture an enemy village.  When his lead platoon was pinned down by enemy fire, Captain Storter rushed forward through open terrain under intense enemy fire to reach his the platoon.  From an exposed position, he then directed his rear elements to move forward and place heavy suppressive fire on the enemy position.  While awaiting the arrival of helicopter gunships, Captain Storter personally employed a 60-millimeter mortar against the enemy.  Upon arrival of the supporting gunships, Captain Storter led a successful attack, routing the enemy.  The unit then moved on to capture its original objective.  During his third tour of duty in Vietnam, Captain Storter assembled a four-man military free fall parachute team (HALO) to conduct a reconnaissance mission deep into enemy territory.  August 10th, 1971, the team jumped from 15,000 feet, conducted their reconnaissance mission, and were safely extracted four days later.  Captain Storter led the first successful combat HALO mission in U.S. Military history.  Major Storter completed his Ranger career by serving as a Ranger Instructor and Commander of the Florida Ranger Camp.  Major Storter surely lived the Ranger Creed as he confronted the enemies of the United States.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Ulysses G. “Blackie” Auger is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in recognition of his heroic service during World War II with the 4th Ranger Battalion in Sicily and the Italian peninsula and, thereafter, his outstanding leadership, exemplary character, and exceptional achievements in business.  After basic training and radio school, Auger shipped out to North Africa.  Responding to a call from Colonel Darby for volunteers to reconstitute the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Battalions, Auger completed Ranger training and, in July 1943, embarked in a thirty man assault boat in the first wave of the invasion into Sicily. The 1st and 4th Ranger Battalions overcame entrenched forces and withering fire to disable the enemy coastal batteries. They also repelled attacks by Italian tanks and the formidable Hermann Goering Division, gaining control of Licata and Gela. The Fourth then led the attack into Maiori, the right flank of the invasion at Salerno, and secured the beaches to allow the 1st and 4th Ranger Battalions into Chiunzi Pass overlooking the main Naple-Salerno road. They secured the towns and the coast road, and overcame fierce attacks by superior enemy forces to join the 1st and 4th Ranger Battalions in gaining Naples. Severely wounded during the terrible winter campaign at Venafro, Auger came home to Walter Reed to recuperate and for separation from service.  For his conspicuous bravery, he earned the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Combat Infantry Badge, and the European Theater Medal with three Battle Stars.  Upon returning to civilian life, Auger made an indelible mark as a businessman and entrepreneur in Washington, DC. He became a leading icon in a city of icons by growing a hot dog stand into the renowned and very successful restaurant, “Blackie’s House of Beef,” where he counted Presidents and politicians, locals, and tourists, among his loyal clientele. That restaurant eventually spun off nine more.  He opened the elegant Black Russian restaurant in 1966 in the basement of the D.C. Welfare Department building “because we wanted to give people on welfare, and people in the neighborhood a nice place to eat.”  There he served veal and Salisbury steak for sixty cents.  He acquired an interest in the Mayflower Hotel, where he had worked as a busboy after dropping out of high school to help support his Greek immigrant family. He invested successfully in financial institutions, realestate, and other national and international business ventures. Ranger Auger distinguished military service as a member of the 4th Ranger Battalion during World War II combined with his civilian accomplishments clearly demonstrates that “Rangers Lead the Way!”</citation>

He was the Co-Chair of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial of Texas, with President George H.W. Bush as the Honorary Chair. Mr. Burkett became a self-appointed watchdog for the reputation of Vietnam veterans. He has exposed the fraudulent claims of over two thousand ‘self-appointed’ individuals; several hundred of these have claimed to be Rangers. These frauds had abused the sacrifice that real Vietnam veterans made, all in the name of personal gain. Mr. Burkett has set the record straight concerning the contributions of the Vietnam veterans. He has spent many hours researching, correcting and writing about Vietnam veterans and discrediting the negative stereotype that have wrongly been placed upon them. He co-authored a book titled “Stolen Valor, How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History,” which won the William E. Colby Award for outstanding military book in 2000. He received the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Army’s highest award for a civilian, presented by President George H.W. Bush at the Bush Library, Texas A&amp;M University.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel Robert L. Howard, a Medal of Honor recipient, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his service against an armed enemy of the United States and for service within the Ranger Community.  He distinguished himself under hostile fire numerous times, earning the Medal of Honor, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Colonel Howard then a Sergeant First Class, distinguished himself while serving as platoon sergeant of an American- Vietnamese platoon which was on a mission to rescue a missing American soldier in enemy controlled territory in the Republic of Vietnam. The platoon had left its helicopter landing zone and was moving out on its mission when it was attacked by an estimated two-company force. During the initial engagement,Colonel Howard was wounded and his weapon destroyed by a grenade explosion. Colonel Howard saw that his platoon leader had been wounded seriously and was exposed to fire. Although unable to walk, and weaponless, Colonel Howard unhesitatingly crawled through a hail of fire to retrieve his wounded leader. As Colonel Howard was administering first aid and removing the officer's equipment, an enemy bullet struck one of the ammunition pouches on the lieutenant's belt, detonating several magazines of ammunition. Colonel Howard momentarily sought cover and then realized that he must rejoin his platoon, which had been disorganized by the enemy attack. Again he started to drag the seriously wounded officer toward the platoon area. Through his outstanding example of indomitable courage and bravery, Colonel Howard was able to rally the platoon into an organized defense force. With complete disregard for his safety, Colonel Howard crawled from position to position, administering first aid to the wounded, giving encouragement to the defenders and directing their fire on the encircling enemy. For over three and one-half hours Colonel Howard's small force and supporting aircraft successfully repulsed enemy attacks and finally were in sufficient control to permit the landing of rescue helicopters. Colonel Howard personally supervised the loading of his men and did not leave the bullet-swept landing zone until all were aboard safely. Colonel Howard's gallantry in action, his complete devotion to the welfare of his men at the risk of his life were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army. In addition, Colonel Howard earned the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and eight Purple Hearts.  Serving as Company Commander of three different companies in the Second Ranger Battalion, Colonel Howard performed in a superior manner. Colonel Howard approached every situation with a determination not only to succeed, but to excel.</citation>

   <citation>Staff Sergeant Danny Lee Jacks is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for exemplary leadership and courage during long range reconnaissance patrols in 1969 and 1970 while assigned to Company G (Ranger), 75th Infantry Regiment, Americas (23rd Infantry) Division.  Specifically, in August 1970, Staff Sergeant Jacks was assigned the mission of conducting an area reconnaissance southeast of Tra Bong, Vietnam; with a secondary mission to capture enemy personnel.  While on the patrol, the team became aware of a hostile force in the vicinity.  Staff Sergeant Jacks’ team watched as the enemy force, consisting of more than the one hundred thirty men, passed in front of the team’s concealed position.  The team’s plan was to allow the enemy element to pass, picking a straggler or two at the end of the enemy column.  But, as the team began to execute this plan, the team came under heavy fire as a result of a counter ambush by the enemy. Reacting to the urgency of the situation and recognizing that his team was also in danger of an assault by the larger enemy element that had passed them, Staff Sergeant Jacks, immediately and unhesitatingly, led a counter assault against the enemy’s ambush position.  Without regard to the personal danger involved, Staff Sergeant Jacks maintained a highly accurate barrage of small arms fire that eliminated two of the enemy attackers and routed the remainder of the hostile soldiers.  Then, recognizing the need to regroup and reassess the larger enemy unit’s strength and position relative to his team, Staff Sergeant Jacks led his men across a stream when the team again suddenly came under intense hostile fire.  Although he was wounded in the ensuing fierce exchange of fire, Staff Sergeant Jacks directed his men to defensive positions while continuing to engage the enemy.  Again, with complete disregard for his personal safety, Staff Sergeant Jacks repeatedly exposed himself to the enemy’s fire while marking their positions for friendly fire support.  Despite the continued pressure, he remained in his vulnerable position until the enemy force was completely defeated.  Through his timely and courageous actions, he contributed greatly to the overall success of the mission and served as an inspiration to his entire unit.  Staff Sergeant Jacks’ commitment to his men, and his resolve to complete the mission set him apart for all time as an exceptional role model for all military leaders.  His personal courage, high skill level and competence, and his devotion to duty, his team, and his Country are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, the Ranger community, and the US Army.</citation>

He was selected for instructor duty in the Florida Ranger Division following his initial assignments with both Ranger and mechanized units in the 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.  In 1980, he was selected to command “Hardrock Charlie” Company, 1st / 75th Ranger Battalion.  This unit had participated three months earlier in the aborted “Desert One” operation to free American hostages in Iran.  His company continued the planning and intensified training in preparation for possible future attempts to free the hostages.  Following a series of key assignments as an operations officer in Washington, D.C., he was selected to command the 6th Ranger Training Battalion at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.  Following that command and a brief assignment as Director of Ranger Special Operations Forces in the Pentagon, he was designated for a second battalion command, assuming command of the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Fort Benning, Georgia. In September 1992, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, deployed with a full combat load, jumped into Great Britain and conducted live fire exercises for three days receiving high praise from senior commanders.  In late October 1992, Colonel Keneally volunteered to be the chief evaluator for 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment conducting contingency missions in Utah.  He realized the sensitivity of the evaluations since the Ranger Commander being evaluated was taking 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment through a real world training exercise.  Both Ranger Commanders met their ultimate death when the helicopter they were in crashed near Salt Lake City.

Ranger Kimsey’s philanthropy began when he established an orphanage in Vietnam that he has supported financially for thirty eight years. In 1985 Ranger Kimsey applied the Ranger Creed to his outstanding success in business as the Founding Chief Executive Officer of America Online, Inc. In 1996, he left AOL to explore new challenges in business, philanthropy and personal diplomacy.  He created the Kimsey Foundation to provide grants that benefit the community and level the field for Washington DC’s disadvantaged youth.  Ranger Kimsey has founded and served on the boards of a number of successful businesses in the Washington, D.C. area.  Ranger Kimsey is also deeply engaged in international humanitarian affairs. As Chairman of the Board of Refugees International he visited Bosnia, Timbuktu and Cambodia to assess refugee repatriation, land mine removal and other human rights concerns. In 2001 Ranger Kimsey was named Chairman of the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP). Kimsey’s work with ICMP has taken him to Iraq and the Balkans, to name a few, to negotiate the release of information for the location of mass graves, their exhumation and the identification process to provide peace and reconciliation to the war torn nations. Ranger Kimsey traveled twice to the rebel held Colombian village of Los Pozos to meet with leftist guerrilla leader Manuel Marulanda, the founder and chief of the powerful Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly called the FARC. The FARC known for earning huge profits from illegal drug trade and kidnapping. These discussions boosted fledgling peace talks by exposing the FARC to the outside world. In 1998, he received KPMG Peat Marwick’s High Tech Entrepreneur Award, the American Academy of Achievement’s Golden Plate Award, and the first annual “I Have A Dream” Award from the I Have A Dream Foundation.  In 1999, Ranger Kimsey received the Horatio Alger Award and a place in the Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame. In May of 2003, he received the first Kellogg Award for Distinguished Leadership from the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.  Ranger Kimsey applies the Ranger Creed to his life and demonstrates that “Rangers Lead the Way”.</citation>

   <citation>First Lieutenant Jack L. Knight, a Medal of Honor recipient, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for extraordinary heroism during World War II.  First Lieutenant Knight was the Commander of Troop F, 124th Cavalry, assigned to the MARS Task Force, the successor of the GALAHAD Task Force (commonly referred to as Merrill’s Marauders) and the second long range penetration group to operate in Burma.  On 2 February 1945, near Loi-Kang, Burma, First Lieutenant Knight led his troop against heavy concentrations of enemy mortar, artillery, and small arms fire.  After taking the troop’s objective and while making preparations for a defense, he discovered a nest of Japanese pillboxes and foxholes to his right front.  Preceding his men by at least ten feet, he immediately launched an attack. Single-handedly, he knocked out two enemy pillboxes and killed the occupants of several foxholes.  While attempting to knock out a third pillbox, he was struck and blinded by an enemy grenade.  Although unable to see, he rallied his troop and continued forward in the assault on the remaining pillboxes.  Before the task was completed he fell mortally wounded.  First Lieutenant Knight’s gallantry and intrepidity were responsible for the successful elimination of most of the Japanese positions and served as an inspiration to the officers and men of his troop. On 3 May 1945, the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously to First Lieutenant Jack L. Knight. It was presented to his father at Camp Wolters, Texas in June 1945.  Ranger Knight, truly lead the way paying the ultimate sacrifice to his country.</citation>

   <citation>Captain John Francis Murphy (J. Frank) is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for courageous leadership and distinguished bravery as a Platoon Leader during a daring raid to rescue his fellow Allied prisoners of war at Cabanatuan, Philippines in January, 1945.  Captain Murphy entered the Army at Fort Devens, Massachusetts as an enlisted member of the 104th Infantry on August 6th, 1943. He later trained at Fort Benning, Georgia and took advanced Ranger training in the Southwest Pacific. When the Allies landed at Luzon, Philippines, his unit, the 6th Ranger Battalion, was chosen to free the 514 Allied prisoners of war held twenty six miles east of Manila behind Japanese lines at Camp Cabanatuan.  Included in the POW ranks were some of the survivors of the Bataan Death March of 1942.  Led by Captain Henry Mucci and First Lieutenant Robert Prince, the one hundred and twenty Rangers and fourteen US Alamo Scouts spent two days maneuvering close to the enemy prison camp guarded by 243 heavily armed Japanese defenders. Secrecy and stealth were of the essence.  When the main patrol was in place in the front of the main gate, then First Lieutenant Murphy was assigned to lead the 2nd Platoon of F Company to crawl through a tunnel to the other side of the road alongside the compound and then along the east side to the rear of the prison. Captain Mucci chose First Lieutenant Murphy to lead this element because of his mature demeanor and his cool Ranger composure. Without the tower guards detecting any movement, First Lieutenant Murphy led his Rangers to the back and setup his position to prevent any withdrawal of the enemy. First Lieutenant Murphy was to shoot the first shot to indicate that the attack from all sides was to commence. After making sure that all his men were in place and ready, he aimed and fired his M1 rifle to begin the most daring and largest rescue of Allied Forces during World War II. The mission was a success with all prisoners being released and escorted safely back to American field hospitals.  All enemy guards were annihilated with only two Ranger casualties. Captain John Murphy received the Silver Star for his bravery and courage in the face of enemy resistance. Despite being quiet and unassuming, Captain Murphy carried out his dangerous assignment with great valor, thorough combat leadership, and humble courage in the Ranger tradition of Leading the Way.</citation>

   <citation>William T. Palmer is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his actions as a professional soldier in the truest meaning of the word soldier.  Ranger Palmer spent thirty years serving in Airborne, Ranger, and Special Forces units.  He was one of the original cadre for the 101st Recondo School under Major “Bayonet” Millet at Fort Campbell, Kentucky in 1958-59.  He then served on the Ranger Training team with the ARVN Division near Hue, Vietnam in 1961-62.  He then worked as patrol chief and Tac Officer at Ranger Mountain Camp in 1965 and then joined the 173rd Airborne Brigade in 1966 where he founded and commanded the 173rd Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol.  He led the entire platoon through the very first class of the MACV Recondo School.  While commanding the 173rd LRRP, he developed the emergency extraction rig used extensively within the 173rd Airborne Brigade.  He then spent two years as an exchange officer at the British Infantry School before returning to Vietnam to command an infantry battalion with the 101st Airborne Division in 1970.  He returned again to the Ranger Department and was Chief Evaluator for Ranger ROTC Camp in 1972.  He went on to serve as 7th Special Forces Commander and J-3 for JSOC.  As JSOC J-3 he made the recommendations and requirements to JCS to increase the number of Ranger Battalions to support JSOC. This led to the formation of 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment and the 75th Ranger Regimental Headquarters by the Army. He retired as Commander of the United States Army Airborne and Special Operations Test Board.  Ranger Palmer’s thirty years of outstanding service included three tours of combat duty in Vietnam earning him the Soldiers Medal and seven Bronze Stars (four with “V” device), Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman’s Badge and the Master Parachutist Badge (with Combat Star).  He is a legend to the men he served with and is known as “The godfather of the 173rd LRRP”.</citation>

   <citation>Master Sergeant Harold L. Rinard is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his actions as a Ranger in both World War II and the Korean War.  He entered the service before WW II with the 34th Infantry Division of the Iowa National Guard.  In Northern Ireland, he was one of the first to volunteer for Darby’s Rangers. Ranger Rinard was with the landings at North Africa, Salerno, and Anzio, was in the Sicilian Campaign and was with all the major Ranger combat actions of those campaigns.  He was wounded three times:  first at the battle for the Chiuniz Pass, second on November 30, 1943 in the high mountains of central Italy, and third at Anzio.  When the 1st Ranger Battalion was expanded into the 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions in French Morocco, he volunteered for the 3rd  Battalion and was promoted to sergeant for his leadership skills.  When the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions were leading an attack on Cisterna to break out of the Anzio beachhead, they were struck by the German Hermann Goering Panzer Division and sustained heavy casualties.  Only six Rangers returned to friendly lines, about fifty percent of the group having been killed and the remaining Rangers having been captured. Wounded, Ranger Rinard was taken to Poland where he escaped twice and linked up with a British unit on the second escape.  When the Korean War started, Rinard was with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and when the call was made for Ranger volunteers, he was heard to say “ONCE A RANGER ALWAYS A RANGER”.  He joined 3rd Airborne Ranger Company at Fort Benning at the beginning of October 1950 as their first cycle of training was starting.  He was with 3rd Company for their first graduation on November 13, 1950, and assisted with training of 3rd Company’s second cycle Rangers that went to combat later.  During Christmas leave Rinard was assigned to a replacement packet for Ranger companies in combat.  He joined 1st Airborne Ranger Company while they were attached to the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division.  In an ensuing battle, five Chinese regiments surrounded 1st Company at a place called Chipyong-ni.  Ranger Rinard led an attack by his platoon gaining a key hill position that could bring fire on the enemy and halt their advance.  He was among the first to the top of the hill and was later killed in action that day, February 15, 1951.  Chipyong-ni is sometimes referred to as the “BASTOGNE” of the Korean War and Ranger Rinard will always be remembered, “Surrender is not a Ranger word.”</citation>

   <citation>Sergeant Thomas Clement Robison is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for providing an extraordinary example of what a Ranger should be, not only in the field of battle as a Ranger Team Leader, but also in the manner in which he faced the challenge of severe life-threatening wounds that would have broken most men, and, in the way he conducted his life thereafter.  After serving with E Company (Long Range Patrol), 51st Infantry Regiment and G Company (Ranger), 75th Infantry Regiment in the Republic of Vietnam as a Ranger Team Leader in excess of thirty missions, Sergeant Robison volunteered for one last mission before leaving Vietnam to ensure the transition of his team to a new Team Leader.  On that mission a land mine was detonated, and Sergeant Robison was seriously wounded.  He had been blinded, his left leg had been traumatically amputated, his right leg had been badly fractured in four places, and he had several dangerous puncture wounds in his lower body.  In the first ten weeks following his injury alone, he would endure no fewer than twenty surgeries, while undergoing weekly hemodialysis.  He would endure many additional and painful surgeries and procedures during the balance of his eighteen months in hospitals from Japan to Washington to Michigan.  He forged a resolute and Ranger-tough “can do” attitude.  Survival became his primary mission, and he succeeded.  Despite the expectation that he would not survive twenty four hours, he survived.  Despite the expectation that his right leg would require amputation, he would not permit it.  Despite the expectation that he would spend his life in a wheelchair, he walked from the hospital under his own power eighteen months after being wounded.  Sergeant Robison refused to allow his wounds to limit him in any way.  After leaving the hospital, Sergeant Robison returned to college, graduated and went on to earn a law degree.  Rather than enter a commercially lucrative field of law, Sergeant Robison became a court administrator and “led the way” in his community by devoting much of his professional life to helping the young.  He helped youthful offenders have their records expunged so they could join the military.  He became a proponent of the GI Bill.  He was instrumental in building, staffing, designing programs for, and maintaining a juvenile treatment center.  He raised money to develop a day treatment program.  He has presided over cases involving neglect, and physical and sexual abuse of children, always ensuring that the interests of the young were protected. He has touched, in a positive way, the lives of hundreds of young people who have come before him. Sergeant Robison continues today to pass on the knowledge and experience he has gained over the years as an adjunct professor of law at Thomas M. Cooley Law School.  His determination to recover from overwhelming and near fatal wounds reflects the admonition “Surrender is not a ranger word.”  His life after recovery as an attorney, citizen, father, husband, youth advocate and educator clearly demonstrate that he “upholds the prestige, honor, and “esprit de corps” of the Ranger Regiment. Sergeant Robison has lived a life that clearly demonstrates that “Rangers Lead the Way!”</citation>

   <citation>Captain Sidney A. Salomon is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his outstanding heroism and exemplary leadership during the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the Battle of Hurtgen Forest.  As one of the original volunteers for the Second Ranger Battalion, then ranger Salomon, a Lieutenant at the time was assigned as Platoon Leader of Second Platoon, C Company, and it was in that role that he participated in the Ranger assault at Point et Raz de la Percee on 6 June 1944.  The first Ranger to step off his landing craft, he led his unit on a mission to capture a fortified, elevated enemy position that could disrupt the landing at Omaha Beach.  Fighting through brutal mortar and automatic weapon fire, Ranger Salomon was wounded as he crossed one hundred yards of heavily defended beach.  He unified the eight remaining members of his platoon and began the ascent of seventy foot cliffs.  In a fierce battle, he personally led the clearing of a trench network and its defensive positions.  Refusing evacuation for his wound, he provided exemplary leadership in the days following the assault and during the Rangers advance inland.  For his courage and leadership, he was awarded the Silver Star, French Croix de Guerre-Chevalier, and Legion of Merit.  On 8 June 1944, he was assigned by LTC Rudder to command B Company, 2nd Ranger Battalion, which he did as the company fought its way across Europe.  Receiving a battlefield promotion to Captain, he led B Company on a deep advance into the heavily wooded, enemy controlled Hurtgen Forest.  Ordered to take an important tactical position and hold it at all costs, B Company succeeded despite heavy casualties from incessant artillery and mortar barrages.  Without concern for his personal safety, Captain Salomon moved from foxhole to foxhole, bringing supplies and encouragement to his Rangers.  Braving intense fire, he moved alone to make contact with an adjacent unit and then returned to his unit.  Wounded by a direct hit on his command post, Captain Salomon rendered first aid and helped evacuate other wounded before being treated himself.  Cited for gallantry and leadership, he was awarded a second Silver Star.  For his service, he was also awarded the Combat Infantryman’s Badge, Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, and European Theater of Operation Medal with five battle stars and bronze arrowhead.  Sidney Salomon continued his service to the Rangers as President of the Northeast Chapter, and then National President, of the World War II Ranger Battalions Association.</citation>

After three years he enlisted in the Army for Airborne Training in 1949.  When the call was made for volunteers to be trained as Army Rangers, he eagerly submitted his name and became one of the original members of 2nd Airborne Ranger Infantry Company.  He participated in all company campaigns and raids from the time that the 2nd Airborne Ranger Company arrived in Korea until the company was deactivated in August 1951. Serving as Assistant Squad Leader when his Squad Leader was killed in action, he assumed command of the squad and conducted numerous patrols, raids and deep penetration operations against North Korean and Chinese forces.  On 14 January 1951, at the Battle of Major-ri, when the 2nd Ranger Company suffered grievous casualties, he saved the life of a wounded fellow Ranger by literally carrying him from the scene of battle to the aid station for medical treatment. This heroic rescue was done at night covering approximately three miles over mountainous terrain with deep snow and severely bitter cold weather conditions. He then returned to the battle area to assist in setting up a blocking action.  Following the 23 March 1951 Munsan-ni Combat Jump, he led his squad as the spearhead on a mission to link-up with elements of the 3rd Infantry Division on 27 March.  He volunteered for a second combat tour in Korea and joined the 24th Infantry Division where he was promoted to Master Sergeant and served as a Platoon Sergeant.

   <citation>Command Sergeant Major Weekley is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for distinguishing himself by his valor in combat, exemplary performance of civilian and military duties, and his sterling character.  He began his military career by volunteering, as a Private to serve in the Green Berets.  He is a graduate of Ranger School, a Master Parachutist, and Pathfinder. He retired as a Command Sergeant Major, has a BS degree in Resource Management, and now is the Ft. Benning Range Management Officer.  Ranger Weekley volunteered to serve in Vietnam in Company D (Ranger), 151st Infantry and then extended to serve in Company F (Ranger), 75th Infantry.  There he was awarded two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, Air Medal, and several other citations.  One reads, as the Assistant Patrol Leader, “when attacked by automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades, he moved forward and placed effective fire on the enemy.”  Based upon his bearing, combat experiences, and keen mind, he was then selected to be the Operations Sergeant for the Headquarters Commandant, 82nd Airborne Division Headquarters.  Upon returning to Vietnam he served as an Advisor to the 1st and 6th Airborne Battalions and the famous 81st Airborne/Ranger Co, ARVN.  There he earned two more Bronze Stars, Vietnam Cross of Gallantry w/Palm, and the Silver Star.  A Bronze Star citation states, while engaging an enemy company in a bunker system, “Weekley assisted in a link-up with friendly forces by leading his unit while under fire” and “then exposed himself to the enemy while effecting the helicopter extraction”.  In a later action, the Silver Star citation states, upon encountering two enemy companies “he immediately advanced under intense fire” and then “with total disregard for his own safety, exposed himself repeatedly while advancing to a position where he could direct fire support and tactical aircraft” his actions “resulted in the main enemy force being destroyed”.  His record and abilities earned him numerous choice assignments: Scout Platoon Sergeant, 1/508th and Platoon Sergeant 2/505th Infantry, and Recondo School Instructor, 82nd Airborne Division; Scout Platoon Sergeant and Infantry Platoon Sergeant, 1/16th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division; Operations Sergeant and 1SG, 1st Infantry Division Forward, (FRG); Ranger Instructor, Committee Chief, 1SG, and Camp Sergeant Major, Florida Ranger Camp. After attending the Sergeants Major Academy he served as Sergeant Major, Directorate of Plans Training and Mobilization, Fort Benning; returned to the Florida Ranger Camp as the Camp Sergeant Major; and then became the Sergeant Major of the Ranger Department.  There he was instrumental in the re-organization of the Ranger Department to the Ranger Training Brigade, where he retired in 1992 with twenty five years of military service to our nation.  His valor in combat, his excellence in performance of all duties, and his outstanding character place him well above his peers.  Ranger Weekley has always “shouldered more than his shared of the task, whatever it may be, 100% and then some”.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel Rodney J. Wijas is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame by demonstrating extraordinary valor and unparalleled leadership during combat operations in South Vietnam and a  thirty two year exemplary military career of unwavering dedication and loyal service.  Upon entering the Army in 1960, he quickly rose through the ranks and attained the rank of Staff Sergeant by the age of 21.  He volunteered for duty in Vietnam in1965 and was assigned to the 43rd Biet Dong Quan (Ranger) Battalion. Demonstrating a can-do trait harking back to soldiers of earlier wars, Staff Sergeant Wijas was instrumental in securing numerous M-60 machine guns and then implemented a rigorous training program for the BDQ soldiers. The battalion soon used this enhanced firepower with great effect in numerous engagements.  As part of a battalion assault force, in one of many close combat air assaults against Viet Cong forces in the IV Corps military region, the BDQ Company which he advised was trapped in a furious and deadly ambush. Cut off without further possible air landed support, Staff Sergeant Wijas helped direct helicopter gunship fire support on the enemy positions perilously close to his own. Then by shear will, dint of brazen courage, he encouraged the rapidly dwindling BDQ force to continue to close onto the enemy bunker line. In a burst of gunfire and Èlan Staff Sergeant Wijas and a small group of BDQ stalwarts reached the enemy positions where Staff Sergeant Wijas was suddenly cut down by a shower of grenade fragments. For his extraordinary heroism and undaunted courage, Staff Sergeant Wijas was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and the Purple Heart. Staff Sergeant Wijas was recognized by his superiors and the BDQ soldiers he advised for his fearless leadership, poise and prompt actions during numerous contacts with enemy forces. His knowledge of Ranger tactics and skill in training and the employment of a wide variety of weaponry were instrumental in assuring the many battlefield successes of the 43rd BDQ. In addition to the DSC, Staff Sergeant Wijas was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with "V" Device with Oak Lead Cluster, the coveted Combat Infantry Badge and other Vietnamese awards for gallantry in action. After leaving the service in 1966 Staff Sergeant Wijas earned a college degree and after deciding to return to the military was subsequently commissioned a Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. From the beginning of his Marine Corps long military career he was guided by the Ranger principles and his extensive combat experience materially assisted training Marine Force Reconnaissance units to attain a high degree of professionalism and tactical skills. As he advanced through the ranks, Wijas participated in numerous joint USMC and U.S. Army airborne and ranger unit exercises. Staff Sergeant Wijas, now a retired as a Colonel, USMC, has brought great credit upon himself during a long and dedicated career in two military services. His undaunting valor, military skill and dedication to duty contributed to forging the Ranger force that we know today and he did so in accordance with the Ranger Creed, "Rangers Lead the Way."</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Charles Carrier, the commander of the 1st Ranger Infantry Co (Airborne) in Korea, was captured by enemy forces May 1951 after completing a mission. This was during the “May Massacre”, in which a large enemy force of several armies attacked the 2nd Inf. Div among others. In captivity, the enemy wanted to humiliate this Ranger officer and find out information about Ranger operations. Ranger Carrier initially escaped, but was recaptured, and placed in the “HOLE,” a famous torture/holding area for prisoners. Ranger Carrier knew his fellow Soldiers were pulling for him and he didn’t want to let them down. Ranger Carrier died as a POW September 30, 1951. Prior to his death, he refused to lie down and quit, and was quoted “I may die, but I will not give up”. In 2005, a witness said, “imagine 50 years ago, as prisoners, we were down, vulnerable, and we prayed. Then we see this Ranger officer, solid as a rock, under repetitive torture and humiliation. He lifted our spirit.† We drew strength from his strength, and we too became more courageous to overcome our fear”.† Ranger Carrier experienced a torturous ordeal as a POW. He provided tremendous inspiration and energy to those prisoners around him to survive the terrible months ahead. He left a secure army position, his family, and volunteered for combat with the Rangers to serve his country.† He set the example and in true Ranger fashion never quit and always led the way.</citation>

During his career he served with distinction in OPERATIONS JUST CAUSE, UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, and JOINT ENDEAVOR as well as many other specialized operations in high threat areas that include El Salvador, Columbia, Lebanon, Honduras, and Kuwait.† During Operation Just Cause, his Squadron was responsible for cornering and capturing the elusive dictator Manuel Noriega. Ranger Connell was the first American to wrestle the dictator to the ground, place flex cuffs on him, and then turn him over to United States authorities. As the Command Sergeant Major of 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, he developed hundreds of junior non-commissioned officers by restructuring a team leader development course focused on tactical shooting, combat focused physical training, and fighting the urban fight. Since his retirement in 2001, Command Sergeant Major Connell continues to serve Rangers in a different capacity as the 5th Ranger Training Battalion’s Tactical Safety Specialist.† No matter what the task, in peacetime and in conflict, and even after retiring from the military, Ranger Connell is the epitome of an Army Ranger, leading from the front and fighting on to the Ranger objective to complete the mission.</citation>

Ranger Gardner’s recon platoon was advancing to relieve a company of the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry that had been pinned down by a numerically superior enemy force in the village of My Canh, Vietnam. The enemy occupied a series of strongly fortified bunker positions that were mutually supporting and expertly concealed. As Ranger Gardner moved his platoon to begin the attack, the enemy fire intensified. Leading the assault and disregarding his own safety, Ranger Gardner charged through a withering hail of fire across an open rice paddy and sequentially destroyed three enemy bunkers, allowing him battlespace to reorganize his platoon and continue the attack. Again pinned down by enemy fire from several more bunkers, he immediately collected several grenades and charged the enemy position, firing his rifle as he advanced to neutralize the defenders.† He destroyed two more bunkers before he was gravely wounded and fell dead on the rim of the last bunker. His extraordinary actions so inspired his men that they resumed the attack and completely routed the enemy. 1LT Gardner earned the Medal of Honor that day and inculcated the Ranger spirit in the men he saved and the enemies that he killed.</citation>

He was instrumental in assisting in the funding for, and the dedication of, the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, and the National D-Day Museum in Louisiana. Mr. Hanks said in an interview: “I am fascinated by this period and see it as something that very much relates to how we live our lives today. The world is still, by and large, a question of what is right and what is wrong. And the best example that we can have at our disposal is to take a look at what happened during the Second World War.”† Mr. Hanks also helped write and produce the critically acclaimed and Emmy Award winning miniseries Band of Brothers.† He hoped that Band of Brothers may remind Americans exactly what The Greatest Generation sacrificed for us. “As filmmakers, we certainly hope to entertain those in search of a great story. We also hope to enlighten those who are unaware of history and those who are unappreciative of the human cost of preserving our great freedoms.” Through his efforts on many fronts from actor, to filmmaker, to spokesman, to chairman, Mr. Hanks has enlightened Americans and the World on the most honorable profession; that of a Soldier.</citation>

LT Ranger was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism while leading his recon platoon during fierce fighting over a span of 3 days in 1969. He engaged an amassed enemy force with direct fire, air strikes, and artillery, and aborted their attack. Wounded by an enemy mortar round that blew him into the air, he refused medical attention and continued to control supporting fires. In the early hours of day 2, an estimated NVA Battalion launched a human wave assault against his platoon, which by this time consisted of only fourteen men. Through fierce fighting using all means at their disposal, LT Ranger called fire on his own position as the enemy entered the perimeter. The following day while the patrol base was receiving small arms and mortar fire, LT Ranger was wounded again while engaging snipers in the trees while his troops were being extracted from the LZ and refused to leave the ground until all of his men were aboard the helicopters. Following a year in the Patrolling Committee at the Ranger Department, Captain Ranger returned to Vietnam to command a company in the 4th Battalion, 503rd Airborne Infantry and was wounded in heavy fighting later that year. He returned to his unit and again was critically wounded resulting in the loss of his right leg above the knee and serious wounds to the left leg. Following reconstructive surgery, he returned to the Ranger Department Patrolling Committee in order to train Rangers in how to truly Lead the Way.

After completing Infantry Basic Training, Advanced Infantry Training, Infantry Officer Candidate School, Ranger and Airborne Training, he deployed to Vietnam with the 1st Cavalry Division.  He served from August 1965 to August 1966 in the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry as a rifle platoon leader and reconnaissance platoon leader.  Ranger Mansfield returned to Vietnam in November 1967 with the 101st Airborne Division.  As a company commander in the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry on February 4, 1968, his company came under devastating enemy fire.  He immediately maneuvered his elements into positions for an attack.  Receiving word that one platoon had been pinned down by enemy automatic weapons fire, he led a second platoon into position for a frontal assault upon the enemy.  When the attack stalled in the face of ravaging fire, he led five men to the enemy’s flank.  With complete disregard for his personal safety, he led a savage charge upon the enemy position that completely destroyed it.  Captain Mansfield repeatedly exposed himself to enemy weapons fire to evacuate his wounded men.  While moving the casualties to safety, he was seriously wounded.  Refusing aid, he continued to direct the evacuation of the wounded and coordinated with an adjoining company for aid.  Only when he was certain that his men were safe, did he agree to his own evacuation.  For his valorous actions, Captain Mansfield was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.  Ranger Mansfield continued to serve veterans as Executive Director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America from 1993-2003.  In January 2004, President George W.

In October 1965, the Special Forces Camp at Plei Me in the II Corps area of South Vietnam was surrounded and under heavy attack by North Vietnamese troops.  A Task Force from Project Delta 5th Special Forces Group was dispatched to the camp to provide relief.  This Task Force included two Vietnamese Airborne Ranger Companies to which Captain Pusser was the Senior Advisor.  Once in the camp a decision was made to deploy the two Ranger Companies to clear the slope north of the camp.  When the Company he was with received intense machine gun fire, the Vietnamese troops became confused and disorganized.  At this time, Captain Pusser began to move through the intense fire in an effort to assist the company commander to bring order to the situation.  After he directed the movement of several wounded to positions of safety, Captain Pusser located the enemy machine gun position, and attempted to set an assault force to neutralize it.  When the assault force had lost all forward movement, Captain Pusser with complete disregard for his own safety jumped to his feet rallied the troops around him and charged the machine gun position.  He was fatally wounded twenty five meters in front of the enemy machine gun position.  Captain Pusser was awarded the Silver Star posthumously for his actions at Plei Me.  Captain Pusser’s conspicuous gallantry in action, are indicative of his leadership abilities, devotion to duty, personal courage, and willingness to Lead the Way.

   <citation>Colonel Stanley Shaneyfelt is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in recognition of an exemplary 30 year military career that significantly impacted on the conduct of the United States and Foreign Ranger Training development and Ranger Unit Combat Operations.  While assigned in the Republic of Korea as a First Lieutenant Shaneyfelt established and supervised a Ranger School for the Korean Army, selecting training areas and base camps, and organizing and training 17 Korean Officer and Noncommissioned Officer Cadre.  Korean Ranger graduates are physically tough and resilient professionals who are held in the highest esteem throughout the Korean Army.  Colonel Shaneyfelt served three combat tours in the Republic of Vietnam, during which he commanded a United States Army Infantry Battalion with distinction.  He further served as a senior advisor to the 33d ARVN Ranger Battalion and the 2nd ARVN Airborne Brigade.  From 30 December 1968 to 10 June 1970, Major Shaneyfelt was assigned as the Deputy Chairman and Chairman, Benning Ranger Committee.  During this period, Major Shaneyfelt completely reorganized the Program of Instruction for the entire Fort Benning phase of Ranger training.  Under his leadership, new, relevant periods of instruction were added for survival, tactical infiltration, aerial and artillery support, and patrol bases based on his combat experience.  Colonel Shaneyfelt was Director of the Ranger Department from June 1985 through June 1987.  During this time frame, the Ranger Department experienced the largest expansion of training responsibilities in its history.  The expansion included increasing Ranger student input to 3080 students annually in FY 1985 and escalating to 3500 students annually over the following two year period.  A Desert Training Phase was implemented at Dugway Proving Ground, UT, that included live fire exercises during the winter of 1987.  Patrol grades were doubled during the Benning phase and tripled in all following phases.  Overall, there was a 40% increase in tactical training in the Ranger Course with a notable decrease in student injuries as strong students were identified earlier and more reinforcement training given to less experienced and less capable soldiers. Two new Programs of Instruction were assigned to the Ranger Department: the Long Ranger Surveillance Unit (LRSU) Course and the Light Leader’s Course.  Doctrinal manuals for the LRSU Program were completed, and two classes were graduated by December of 1986.  The Light Leader Course mission was doubled and 17 classes were graduated in Fiscal Year 86.  Colonel Shaneyfelt has demonstrated over his 30 year career that he not only embodies the Ranger Creed in everything that he has accomplished, but he continues to live by the standards throughout all of his actions for the Ranger community since his retirement.</citation>

   <citation>Elwood L. Dorman was born on April 16, 1924 in Snyder County, Pennsylvania.  He left high school to enter active service on March 26, 1943 at Harrisburg, PA and his first station was at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where he attended basic training.  He participated in maneuvers there with the 75th Infantry Rangers.  He was interviewed, as were all the volunteers, by several veteran Rangers of the 1st Battalion and also by the Interim Battalion Commander.  A month later, he was transferred to Camp Forrest, Tennessee where he joined the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion.  Upon his arrival at Camp Forrest, Private Dorman was assigned to Company D and, within a short time, he began his initiation into the Ranger world.  The initial training exposed the novice to hazardous experiences such as hand to hand combat and the handling and use of high explosives.  He had to endure grueling forced marches and rigorous calisthenics. Elwood met all these challenges successfully and was promoted to the rank of PFC.  When the initial phase of the training was completed, the men who did not meet the Ranger standards were culled out.  Elwood was among the surviving Rangers to accompany the battalion to Fort Pierce for a month of amphibious training under the guidance of the U.S. Navy.  The battalion moved North at the conclusion of this endeavor and had brief stays at Fort Dix and Camp Kilmer before sailing to the British Isles.  The tactical training picked up dramatically in England, Scotland and then back to England again.  During this period, the Rangers trained with the British Commandos from whom they learned how to scale cliffs and mount attacks on hardened gun positions.  They also spent long hours doing landing exercises from LCAs that were operated by crews from the Royal Navy; this exposure familiarized the Rangers with the British method of operations.  Finally they were briefed on the role they were to play in the Allied assault on the Atlantic Wall.  Now it became quite clear to Elwood and his buddies that the training of the past five months was oriented towards their mission in Normandy.  Elwood participated in the Allied invasion of Normandy, France on June 6, 1944 and his performance there won him the Silver Star. After several days of hard fighting, the 5th Battalion was relieved from the front to refit and was subsequently committed to the siege on the City of Brest.  Elwood prevailed through the battle in spite of a serious foot injury.  After the fall of Brest, Elwood was sent to the hospital in England for rehabilitation.  He was honorably discharged October 30, 1945. Elwood is a Life Member of the Ranger Battalions Association World War II, The RBA Alva Miller South East Chapter and the Ranger Regiment Association.  He has served in office for the Alvah Miller Chapter, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and is a member of the American Legion.</citation>

He entered the United States Military Academy in 1950 graduating in June 1954.  After attending the Infantry Officer Basic Course, Airborne School, and Ranger School, he was assigned to the 65th Infantry Regimental Combat Team.  Because of a very favorable recommendation from an Instructor in the U.S. Army Ranger School (“LT Galvin is the most outstanding Ranger student in his class.”) Galvin’s initial assignment was as an instructor in the 65th RCT NCO Academy.  This Academy was patterned after the Ranger School and was founded and commanded by CPT Ralph Puckett.  Subsequently, he was assigned as a platoon leader and company executive officer, assistant Post S-2 and S-3 and later Post S-2 and S-3, U.S. Army Antilles Command.  Next, at the recommendation of CPT Puckett, who was the first Ranger Advisor to the Escuela de Lanceros, the Colombian Army Ranger School, LT Galvin was assigned to replace CPT Puckett. Galvin, during his 18-month tour with the Lanceros, was instrumental in improving the content and presentation of a very rigorous Program of Instruction and the evaluation of Lancero students. He also was instrumental in informing Colombian senior commanders, staff, and prospective students of the concept and value of Lancero training.  Subsequent to his assignment in Colombia, he was assigned to the 1st Battle Group, 501st Infantry, 101st Airborne Division.  He began the series of command assignments that prepared him for progressively higher command including battalion, brigade, division, corps, Commander-in-Chief, Southern Command, Panama, and ultimately Supreme Allied Commander, Europe/Commander-in-Chief, United States European Command, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.  After retirement, he was assigned to the United States Military Academy as Olin Distinguished Professor of National Security, the first to fill that position.  In 1993, he was appointed Ambassador, U.S. State Department, to assist with negotiations in Bosnia.  In 1994 he joined Mershon Center at the Ohio State University.  In 1995, he became the Dean, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University where he served until 2000.  While on active duty, he served two years in Vietnam, 14 years in Europe, and five years in Latin America.  He has been a board member of many prestigious national defense related institutions and companies including the Center for Creative Leadership, the Institute of Defense Analyses, Raytheon Company, J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co., and Chairman Emeritus of the American Council on Germany.  General Galvin’s exemplary military and civilian service has included taking part in some of the defining issues of the last 50 years, including support of the Gulf War, missile defense of Israel, rescue of 450,000 Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq, East-West negotiation on arms control, redesigning NATO strategy, and U.S. military operations in Zaire, Liberia, and other African nations.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Doug Perry was born on 8 June 1941 in the Mill Creek community located in northern Georgia. In March 1959, Ranger Perry enlisted in the U.S. Army; after Basic Training and Advanced Infantry Training, he was assigned to the 24th Infantry Division in Germany, where he would spend two years as a rifleman and Fire Team Leader honing his Infantry techniques and leadership in demanding field exercises.  In 1961, he was reassigned to the 2nd Ranger Company, Mountain Ranger Camp, Dahlonega, Georgia, where he made the grade of NCO.  He attended the U.S. Army Ranger School, Class 6-62 and was designated Enlisted Honor Graduate.  After Ranger School, he attended the Jungle Warfare School in the Panama Canal Zone.  For twenty years, Ranger Perry’s Army assignments would encompass all aspects of an Infantryman, Paratrooper, and an Army Ranger throughout the world, including nine years as a Ranger Instructor and tours in South Vietnam as a combat Ranger.  Sergeant Perry’s technical competence in many diverse skills, such as Airborne/Airmobile operations, demolitions, weaponry, patrolling and mountaineering was invaluable to the Mountain Ranger Committee and to the thousands of students that he taught.  He made numerous significant and lasting contributions to the upgrading of the Ranger Course.  Due to his experience and expertise, Perry was assigned to the 7th Infantry Division’s Counter-Guerilla Warfare School in Korea.  The school’s mission was to teach and train the Division’s rifle companies in Ranger techniques and counter insurgency, also, small unit leadership.  This was of dire importance because of continuous altercations in the DMZ by the North Koreans in the form of ambushes and attempted infiltrations.  Many of the Soldiers he trained would use their acquired knowledge in future assignments in South Vietnam.  1966, Ranger Perry deployed to Vietnam as a U.S. Army Ranger Advisor to the South Vietnamese Ranger units.  He served back to back tours with two of the most decorated combat units in Vietnam, the 42nd and 44th Vietnamese Ranger Battalions:  the 44th was the first unit – American or Vietnamese – to be awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.  The 42nd received the Presidential Unit Citation twice.  Ranger Perry was assigned to the U.S. Army Alaska Command in 1970, as a Platoon Sergeant and the acting First Sergeant of Company C ABN, 6th Battalion, 9th Infantry.  This company had the distinction of being the “Most Northern Airborne Unit” in the U.S. Army.  The unit conducted Airborne and field operations in extreme Arctic temperatures as much as fifty degrees below zero in harsh weather conditions.  Ranger Perry’s last assignment was with the 14th Company TSB, Fort Benning, Georgia.  He was the First Sergeant of the 400 member unit until his retirement in 1979.  Ranger Perry’s military qualifications and awards include the Combat Infantryman Badge, Expert Infantryman Badge, Ranger Tab, Master Parachutist Badge, Canadian Parachutists Badge, Vietnamese Ranger Badge, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry w/ Palm.</citation>

   <citation>Ellis “Bill” Reed was born on January 3, 1925 in Newark, New Jersey.  He attended Bloomfield Senior High School but left after his junior year and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Camp Gordon.  When he got there, he was interviewed by past Ranger and made to jog around Camp Gordon and do push ups before answering the questions.  He quickly got the message: the more tired you are, the harder it was for to you to think.  On September 1st, he was transferred to Camp Forrest, Tennessee and joined Company D, 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion. Upon his arrival, the initiation to the Ranger world would first be physical exercise before breakfast and then hand to hand combat, use of explosive gaveling, and forced marches to the range.  If you fired on the rifle range tired and did a good job, you passed the test.  PFC Reed was among the surviving Rangers.  After that, it was to Fort Pierce, Florida.  There the men had to paddle against the tide.  Tactical training in England and the Scottish Commando Course followed and was a make or break situation.  The Commando Course consisted of scaling cliffs and night navigation.  The beach landing and cliff scaling were the Australian method of head first.  Finally the team was briefed about the Atlantic Sea Wall invasion.  The invasion was made by the 5th Ranger Battalion under LTC Max Schnieder.  He led the way toward Dog White Beach, which was on fire and covered in smoke.  When the battalion’s advance was halted after it encountered a strongly fortified enemy seawall, Ranger Reed immediately left the protection of the seawall with a Ranger buddy to his flank and proceeded to slide a Bangalore torpedo under a barbed wire obstacle. His successful breach of the obstacle triggered a company assault which resulted in the neutralization of the enemy fortifications. D Day was June 6, 1944.  Operations continued at Brest and then the German border during the eleventh month of 1944 and finally finished in Ried, Austria.  Ranger Reed’s awards and decorations include the Silver Star; the Bronze Star; Purple Heart; Combat Infantry Badge; Arrowhead Beach Landing; four Battle Stars; two Presidential Unit Citations; French Cruix DeGuere with Silver Gilt Star.  Upon return to the United States, Ranger Reed joined the Active Army Reserves, 78th Division Training were he served as the Captain of the S3, 3rd Brigade Armor.  Ranger Reed retired in December 1969 with a total of 20 years of military service.</citation>

   <citation>John Walter Ripley was born June 29th, 1939 in Radford, Virginia.  Ranger Ripley served 35 years active duty in the Marines.  Graduating June 1957 from Radford High School, Ripley served one year of enlisted service in the Marine Corps before entering the United States Naval Academy upon obtaining an appointment from the Secretary of the Navy.  In June 1962, Ripley graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in electrical engineering and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant of Marines.  Upon completion of The Basic School for Infantry Officers, Lt. Ripley was assigned Sea Duty with Marine Detachment, USS Independence.  Lt. Ripley was next assigned to 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines, commanding a Rifle Platoon, then Weapons Platoon.  In May 1965 Lt. Ripley was transferred to 2nd Force Reconnaissance where he completed the US Army Airborne Course, Jumpmaster course and US Navy SCUBA School.  Ripley next attended the US Army Ranger Course as a part of Class 05-65.  Successfully completing Ranger Training, now Ranger Ripley was recognized as the Distinguished Officer Graduate and awarded the coveted Ranger Tab.  Upon completion of his Special Operations training, Ranger Ripley deployed overseas with his Force Reconnaissance platoon.  Captain Ripley arrived in Vietnam in October 1966 and took command of Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment (L 3/3) just below the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in the northern sector of South Vietnam’s I Corps.  Ranger Ripley’s Lima Company saw extensive combat action in the famous “Leatherneck Square” area of Dong Ha, Con Tien, Khe Sanh and the “Rock Pile”.  Because of Ranger Ripley’s exceptional leadership and command capabilities, commanders constantly committed Lima Company to active battle sites all along I Corps’ DMZ.  Ranger Ripley was wounded in action on four separate occasions, finally being forced to medically evacuate and recover from his wounds.  Each event qualified for the Purple Heart, but Ranger Ripley skillfully avoided the paperwork and settled for a single award of the medal.  According to Ranger Ripley, “Three Purple Hearts on three occasions would mean mandatory removal from the field, and worse, command!”  Ranger Ripley insisted on returning to command his Company and did so providing experience and leadership until end of tour.  Ranger Ripley returned to Vietnam in 1971 and served as Senior Advisor to the 3rd Vietnamese Marine Battalion, which operated along the DMZ.  Ripley was at Dong Ha with his battalion during the 1972 North Vietnamese Easter Invasion.  It was during this invasion that Ranger Ripley heroically performed the action at the Dong Ha Bridge, for which he was awarded the nation’s second highest honor, the Navy Cross.  John G. Miller’s book, The Bridge at Dong Ha, documents this action.  Returning from Vietnam in 1972, Ranger Ripley became the Marine Officer Instructor at Oregon State University.  In 1975 he attended American University in the Advanced Degree program.  Upon earning a Master of Science, Ripley was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Staff, Headquarters Marine Corps, serving in Special Projects Directorate then later as the Administrative Assistant/Aide to the Chief of Staff.  In 1982 Ranger Ripley attended the Naval War College.  Upon graduation he reported to the Joint Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff, serving as Political-Military Planner and Branch Chief, European Division, J-5.  Ranger Ripley was next assigned to his Alma Mater, the U.S. Naval Academy where he served as Senior Marine and Director, Division of English and History from 1984 – 1987. During this period he established a record of commissioning more than 500 Academy midshipmen into the Marine Corps.  Ranger Ripley next spent a year as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 with 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force in Japan.  In July 1988, Ranger Ripley assumed command of the 2nd Marines and twice deployed the Regiment to Norway.  Ranger Ripley also commanded Regimental Landing Team 2 (RTL 2), a combined reinforced infantry regiment, with armor, artillery and Marine Air, deploying over 10,000 Marines to the Arctic Circle, the first Marine unit of this size ever to do so.  Upon leaving the Regiment, he commanded the Navy-Marine Corps ROTC Unit at Virginia Military Institute.  During his time at VMI, Ranger Ripley created the largest, most productive NROTC unit in the country.  Ranger Ripley has earned six valorous and fourteen personal decorations including the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two awards of the Legion of Merit, two awards of the Bronze Star with Combat “V”, the Purple Heart, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Navy Unit Citation, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Vietnamese Distinguished Service Order and the Cross of Gallantry with Gold Star.  Ranger Ripley’s heroic action at the Dong Ha was selected as a single act to memorialize all naval Academy graduates during the Vietnam War.  In Memorial Hall at The Academy, a large diorama titled “Ripley at The Bridge” represents the noble and gallant actions of all Naval Academy men who fought there.  Following his retirement in June 1992, Col. Ripley became president of Southern Virginia College in Buena Vista, VA.  While there he was credited with saving the financially-troubled college.  After turning the College over to new management, Col. Ripley was asked to remain as Chancellor where he received resolutions and citations from the positive change and sound management practices.  In June 1999, Col. Ripley was selected by the Commandant to serve as the Director of Marine Corps History and Museums and Director of the Marine Corps Historical Center, a position held until his final retirement from the Corps in 2006.  During his years of Vietnam service he participated in 26 major operations which included numerous battles at the Rifle Company, Battalion and Division level.  He has the distinction of more direct combat experience at the rifle company and battalion level than any other Marine.  As a result of combat action, Ranger Ripley contracted a disease that would require a liver transplant in the summer of 2002.  On his death bed with little life left and having twice received Last Rites, one of the Marine Corps’ greatest living heroes was dying.  Once a liver had been located in Philadelphia, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, calling Col. Ripley a living symbol of pride, dispatched helicopters from the Marine One Squadron, the Presidential Fleet, to ferry the transplant team to the University of Pennsylvania hospital to remove the donor liver and then transport the doctors back to Washington for the successful operation.  In October 2006 Col. Ripley returned to the site of the Dong Ha Bridge to film a documentary of his exploits.  The documentary was hosted by Oliver North and featured on an episode of LtCol. North’s “War Stories” on FOX.  Colonel and Mrs. Ripley reside in Annapolis, Maryland.  They have four children.  Two sons are graduates of VMI and each served as Captains of Marines.</citation>

   <citation>Robert W. Scully fought in the Korea War. Honorably Discharged from the New Jersey National Guard, he volunteered for the U.S. Army in September 1946 in Jersey City, New Jersey. Graduating from glider and jump school, he served with the 11th Airborne Division in Japan. While in the 82nd Airborne Division, he volunteered for Ranger units to be trained at Fort Benning, GA. Joining the 3rd Airborne Ranger Company on December 18, 1950, he was assigned as 1st Scout, 1st Squad, and 1st Platoon. Arriving in the Korean War Zone, March 24, 1951, 3rd Company was attached to 3rd Infantry Division. On April 11, 1951, the Company was attached to a tank unit spearheading the division advance. Clearing the village of Kantongyon, Ranger Scully’s Platoon was crossing the open terraced rice paddies and came into heavy mortar and machine gun fire from a well defended enemy hill. A Company Radio Operator was wounded. Realizing the need for communications, PFC Scully continued the assault with the heavy radio on his back. Crossing the first enemy trench, Scully saved the life of Ranger Gus Georgiou, who was too badly wounded to defend himself. Scully killed the Chinese and advised a medic of Georgiou’s location. Starting up the hill, he gave his rifle to a Ranger whose weapon was damaged. Later he located a carbine in time to save wounded Ranger, Don Lee. Two Chinese soldiers were about to kill Lee, Scully killed one, capturing the other. Assuring Lee’s safety, Scully brought the prisoner under fire across 1,500 yards of open rice paddies and turned him over to a tank crew in the center of the valley. Ranger Scully was wounded by a mortar round on the final objective and refused evacuation. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart for his gallantry in action. Concurrently, he saved the lives of two fellow Rangers and maintained essential radio communications throughout the attack.</citation>

   <citation>Leo V. Strausbaugh was born on January 1, 1920 in Hillsboro, Illinois.  He joined the Army on March 24, 1942, and was assigned to the U.S. Army Artillery base at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma for three months of basic training and training on horse drawn artillery. Two months prior to his completion of basic, Leo was selected for OCS. On October 29, 1942, after completing OCS, Leo was promoted to 2nd Lt. and was assigned to the training center mule pack battery with 75 millimeter howitzers. In December of 1942, Leo was reassigned to the 98th Field Artillery Battalion located at Ft. Carson, Colorado. A few weeks later, the 98th was transported to Newport News, Virginia for shipment overseas, destination unknown. Leo was assigned to B Battery, led by Captain Arthur “Bull” Simons. In February of 1944, the 98th’s mules were shipped to Merrill’s Marauders, and LTC Mucci took over the 98th with the purpose of turning those who volunteered into a Ranger Battalion. Leo was one of the first to volunteer. The Ranger training in the mountains and jungles of New Guinea was rigorous. After Leo organized and led an impressive platoon demonstration for 6th Division, he was promoted to 1st Lt. Around the July 1, 1944, companies were organized to reflect the TOE of a Ranger Battalion. Capt. Simons led B Company, and, having his choice of officers, chose Leo to be his second in command. Training and organization completed, Leo and the Rangers were ready for action, just in time to spearhead the invasion of the Philippines.  On October 18, 1944, two days prior to the main invasion force, Leo and B Company landed on Homonhon Island during the initial re-taking of the Philippines, then moved to Suluan to take out a Japanese held lighthouse used to signal enemy ships and send radio messages. Captain Simons made the initial assault on the light house, but he and his men became trapped in the lighthouse and surrounded by Japanese. Leo led thirty-five Rangers to the lighthouse, eliminated the Japanese threat, and rescued Captain Simons.  In January 1945, the invasion force moved into the Lingayen Gulf in preparation for the invasion of Luzon. Ranger Companies B and E secured the island of Santiago, then moved onto Luzon. During May of 1945, Leo was appointed B Company commander and promoted to Captain. Soon thereafter, he was awarded the Bronze Star for leading B Company thirty miles beyond 6th Division front lines, to seek and locate Japanese positions. Leo located the Japanese positions in the vicinity of the IPO Dam and provided the intelligence for 6th Division’s attack.  During June of 1945, Leo’s B Company was chosen to become a third segment of Major Connolly’s task force and take the town of Aparri from the Japanese. Strausbaugh’s Rangers, without the support of the 6th Ranger Bn., traveled over 400 miles on this 30 day mission, positioned themselves on the Cagayan River, gathered intelligence and on June 21st, took Aparri. B Company proceeded to and secured the air strip south of Aparri just prior to a jump by a battalion of paratroopers from the 11th Airborne. Strausbaugh’s Rangers pushed south and made contact with elements of the 37th Division which closed the gap, dividing the Japanese forces and giving the Americans control of the west side of the valley. The Aparri operation sealed the fate of the Japanese in the Philippines and ended combat operations for the 6th Rangers, freeing them to prepare for the invasion of Japan. The dropping of two atom bombs on Japan eliminated the need for that invasion.  Following the war, Leo Strausbaugh, returning to Artillery, served in the U.S. Army Reserve for 28 years and rose to the rank of Colonel in 1969.  In 1959 he graduated from Command and General Staff College (C&amp;GS), Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.  Colonel Strausbaugh served as the Director of Instruction for the 5038th USAR School, 102nd Ozark Division, for five years. In 1973, one year before his retirement, Colonel Leo V. Strausbaugh was inducted into the OCS Hall of Fame at Ft. Sill.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger James J. Altieri is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his meritorious service to the Nation during World War II and for his lifetime dedication to the Ranger community.  In May 1942, Ranger Altieri volunteered for, and subsequently became an original member of, the 1st Ranger Battalion.  After extensive training with the elite British Commandos, Ranger Altieri participated in his first of four amphibious invasions at Arzew, Algeria in support of the Allied invasion of North Africa.  There, his Ranger unit seized multiple gun batteries covering the landing areas of the 1st Infantry Division.  Following the invasion, Ranger Altieri participated in multiple other battles across Algeria and into Tunisia including well-known fights at Sened Station and El Guettar, where the 1st Ranger Battalion earned the Presidential Unit Citation.  At the conclusion of the North African campaign, Ranger Altieri and the rest of the 1st Ranger Battalion served as cadre members tasked with developing the Ranger Force, an organization containing the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Battalions.  Ranger Altieri next served as a platoon sergeant in F Company, 4th Ranger Battalion where he participated in the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy.  During the invasion of Italy, Altieri’s unit landed at Maiori and seized Chiunzi Pass, key terrain that proved vital to the 5th U.S. Army’s swing northward and eventual capture of Naples.  Following this action, General Mark Clark awarded Ranger Altieri a battlefield commission as a result of his performance in combat.  Ranger Altieri later took part in his fourth amphibious invasion at Anzio, Italy, where he served as a company commander during fierce combat at Cisterna.  There, he led his men in bitter fighting trying to come to the aid of the trapped 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions.  Ranger Altieri’s World War II battle honors include 17 battles and raids, five major campaigns, four amphibious landings, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge.  Ranger Altieri ultimately reached the rank of Major in the U.S. Army Reserve.  Ranger Altieri continued to contribute to the Ranger legacy by authoring numerous texts including Darby’s Rangers and The Spearheaders.  He served as president of the Ranger Battalion Association of World War II, where he worked to construct Ranger monuments and establish organizations that would perpetuate the deeds of his comrades.  Some men serve in the Rangers, a few spend their lives in service to the Rangers.  James Altieri was such a man.</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel (Ret) William T. Anton is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his valorous and meritorious service in combat and his devoted service to the Ranger community.  Ranger Anton was a Distinguished Military Graduate of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln where he received his commission as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in February 1970.  Following graduation and completion of the Infantry Officer Basic Course, Airborne and Ranger Schools, LTC Anton deployed to the Republic of Vietnam with Company H (Ranger), 75th Infantry, 1st Cavalry Division where he served as Company Commander and Executive Officer.  Under Ranger Anton’s leadership, Company H earned its 3rd Valorous Unit Award and 4th Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, making it the most decorated unit that served in Vietnam.  In the words of Company H Rangers, “Lieutenant Anton took it upon himself to personally oversee the extraction of every Ranger Team.  These extractions were “hot”, but his only concern was for his Rangers being extracted; we knew he would be in the extraction helicopter to assure the safety of the team.  Additionally, Lieutenant Anton frequently accompanied Company H Ranger Teams to the field on a six man “Hunter-Killer” missions as a Team Member.”  LTC Anton currently serves as Unit Director of Company H (Ranger), 75th Infantry, 75th Ranger Regiment Association where he has served for the past 11 years.  Ranger Anton is a 100% disabled Veteran and has worked tirelessly for Disabled American Veterans, a national organization at which he currently serves as the Adjutant for the state of Nevada.  His service contributed to the increase of the organization’s success rate for filed Veteran’s Affairs claims to 95%, the highest in the country for any military service organization.  In addition to his military expertise, LTC Anton holds a Doctorate in Education from George Washington University and has served on the National Council of Education, where he has led the way in the momentous restructuring of America’s public education system with a major emphasis on special education.  His tireless work contributed to the ultimate passage of the No Child Left Behind Act as well as a renewal of the Individuals With Disabilities Act, promoting educational excellence for all Americans.  LTC Anton exemplifies leading the way and integrally emulates “Sua Sponte” in all that he does!</citation>

   <citation>Colonel A.J. “BO” Baker is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his exemplary service to the Nation.  After 18 distinguished years of service in the most demanding tactical units to include three combat tours in Vietnam, highlighted by him being awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in the defense of the Plei Me Special Forces Camp in October 1965, COL Baker was handpicked from numerous highly-qualified candidates by General Creighton Abrams, then Chief of Staff of the Army, to activate and command the 2nd Ranger Battalion, 75th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington.  As the senior leader in the battalion, he set a clear direction and vision for the chain of command, aligned all resources to support an extremely rigorous training program, and motivated his Rangers to excel at every task.  His personal charisma, tactical competence, physical strength, courage, and genuine love for his Rangers and their families set an example that would be emulated by his leaders for decades to come.  Of note, out of the initial cadre under his command, 12 general officers, six division commanders, three 75th Ranger Regiment commanders, one Delta Force commander, one U.S. Army Special Forces commander, one commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, 15 command and staff Sergeants Major, and 13 full Colonels were produced for the Army.  These leaders not only solidified the tactics, techniques and procedures used by one of the Army’s elite Infantry units, but also proved to be instrumental in transforming and leading our Army and the U.S. military for the next 30 years.  COL Baker was an extraordinary team builder who left a lasting imprint on each of the Rangers he coached and mentored.  He and the Rangers he impacted exemplified the words of the Ranger Creed to “Always endeavor to uphold the prestige, honor and high esprit de corps of the Ranger Regiment.”</citation>

Ranger Alford M. Bukaty is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his distinguished combat service and his constant dedication to Ranger and Veteran’s affairs.  Ranger Bukaty distinguished himself during combat in Korea and later in life as a civilian leader in Veteran’s affairs.  In 1950, parachute-qualified volunteers were sought to train as Rangers with subsequent combat deployment to Korea.  Ranger Bukaty volunteered, trained and later deployed to combat with the 1st Airborne Ranger Company, fighting in four major campaigns while also participating in numerous raids and ambushes behind enemy lines.  On the night of 2 April 1951, Ranger Bukaty’s squad attempted to infiltrate through enemy lines to attack a suspected enemy command post.  He led his assault team forward to overwatch a dangerous draw.  As he advanced, Ranger Bukaty noticed enemy movement.  He deployed his men and engaged the enemy in a firefight.  When his men were pinned down, Ranger Bukaty left his place of cover and dashed forward in a single-handed assault, firing his rifle and hurling grenades.  He killed several of the enemy and threw most others into retreat.  When two remaining enemy soldiers counterattacked with machine guns, Ranger Bukaty killed one of the enemy soldiers and wounded the other.  For this action, he was awarded the Silver Star.  After his discharge from the Army in 1951, Ranger Bukaty attended Kansas State University, established his own successful business, and continued to serve the Nation in the Kansas National Guard.  He was discharged when his unit deactivated.  Ranger Bukaty remained active in Veteran’s affairs, as he served as the leading force in raising funds for the construction of the Kansas “Korean and Vietnam War Memorial.”  Still active in Ranger affairs, he truly is the epitome of our motto: Rangers Lead the way!</citation>

   <citation>First Lieutenant Edwin L. Dean is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his devotion to duty and exemplary service to his country.  With his decision to answer Colonel Darby’s original call for volunteers to attend commando training in Achnacarry, Scotland, Ranger Dean served valiantly across the sands of North Africa, the beaches and mountains of Sicily and Italy to, finally, Cisterna, epitomizing a Ranger’s courage in combat and selfless commitment to duty throughout his participation in World War II.  His actions during the Sened Station raid earned him one of the earliest Silver Stars awarded to a Ranger in World War II.  Acting as a forward scout for the mission, with fixed bayonet Ranger Dean charged a machine gun nest in the face of fierce fire and destroyed the enemy position, enabling the raid to continue.  After the raid, noticing Ranger Joe Dye was not among the wounded at the staging area, Ranger Dean returned alone to evacuate an unconscious Dye.  Two beachheads and a battlefield commission later, Ranger Dean’s commitment to his Ranger band of brothers was demonstrated yet again when, with numerous shrapnel wounds, a broken bone in his foot, and against a doctor’s orders, he went absent without leave from his hospital bed to rejoin his unit as it prepared for the famed assault on Anzio.  Fifty-four years later, his Purple Heart medal finally caught up with him at his home in Missouri.  In addition to being awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart, Lieutenant Dean also proudly wore the Combat Infantryman’s Badge, a Presidential Unit Citation, Bronze Arrowhead, and a European, African, and Middle Eastern Theater Campaign Ribbon with 5 Bronze Stars.   After Cisterna, deactivation, and the war’s end, Ranger Dean returned to civilian life.  However, with the onset of the Korean War Ranger Dean once again answered the Nation’s call to service.  At 30 years of age, he volunteered for Airborne training, earning his wings at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1951.  Until a medical discharge, he was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Throughout his long and productive life, Ranger Dean’s personal integrity and devotion to duty have been an inspiration to all who have known him.</citation>

   <citation>Ranger Russell E. Dodge is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his devotion to duty and exemplary military career that included service in three of our Nation’s wars.  Throughout his long and distinguished military career, Ranger Dodge strived to be the best Soldier and leader possible.  He never hesitated to put himself in harms way and always answered the call when volunteers were needed to perform dangerous missions.  During World War II, he participated in three major campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations.  While serving in combat on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, volunteers were needed for a dangerous mission in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations.  Ranger Dodge answered the call, eventually fighting in Burma with Merrill’s Marauders in two major campaigns.  Following World War II, Ranger Dodge reenlisted for two years and eventually served in the National Guard, where he received a commission as a Reserve officer.  During the Korean War, once again a call came for volunteers for the newly formed Airborne Ranger Companies.  Ranger Dodge answered the call, training with the 13th Airborne Ranger Company, eventually earning the coveted Ranger Tab.  In order to “stay Airborne with trigger pullers,” Ranger Dodge resigned his commission.  This “tough as nails” warrior refused to “leave the troops,” recognizing that this is where his experience would be most beneficial.  Ranger Dodge later volunteered for two separate special operations missions in Laos in 1962 and Vietnam in 1965.  Recognizing exactly where his experience as a leader and teacher would be most valuable, he was later assigned to the Florida Ranger camp where he always led the way by his personal example.  Ranger Dodge was a “Ranger’s Ranger,” highly respected by both his fellow Ranger Instructors and Ranger Students attending the course.  Ranger Dodge’s performance and commitment to duty exemplify what is best about a U.S. Army Ranger and is an extraordinary example of why Rangers Lead the Way!</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel Robert P. Gary is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his exceptional leadership, courage and professionalism spanning a 32 year career in the U.S. Army.  Drafted after high school at the age of 18, Ranger Gary seized an opportunity to excel by joining A Company, 2nd Ranger Battalion.  His unit spearheaded the invasion of France on D-Day, 6 June 1944.  While advancing on shore at Dog Green Beach, Ranger Gary was shot in the leg.  He pushed on, making it up a steep cliff before his injury prohibited his continuance.  After two months of hospital recovery in England, he refused a limited duty assignment and requested to be reunited with his Ranger unit.  Ranger Gary subsequently participated in four more campaigns in World War II, including service in the Hurtgen Forest where he sustained a second injury.  For his service in World War II, Ranger Gary was awarded the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Combat Infantryman’s Badge, the Army Commendation Medal and the Presidential Unit Citation.   Following the war, he received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration from Johns Hopkins University while also being recognized as an ROTC Distinguished Military Graduate.  In September 1951, Ranger Gary was recalled to active duty and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry. His professionalism, leadership, and commitment to duty are evident in the awards and decorations he subsequently received from his service in Korea, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Thailand and various stateside assignments.  Ranger Gary served two tours of duty in Vietnam: first while attached to a Special Forces detachment in the Delta and later as Director of Territorial Forces, Advisory Division, MR3, USMACV.  In this latter position, Ranger Gary received a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster that documented his “exceptional ability to lead and manage personnel” as well as his “high degree of professionalism in planning and coordinating the pacification and rural development program.”  Later, a Legion of Merit recognized him for “devoting long hours to the successful accomplishment of the extremely vital mission of advising the more than 102,000 regional forces in Military Region 3.”  It further states “he established a rapport with his counterparts equaled by few advisors and gained the respect of all who were associated with him.”  Ranger Gary has honored his association with the Rangers and has stayed true to its doctrine of excellence throughout his military career.</citation>

Murphy is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in recognition of his 26 years of exceptional meritorious service while serving in Ranger units in war and peace, as well as later reaching the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 3 as a U.S. Army Aviator.  Ranger Murphy first volunteered to serve in Charlie Company, Ranger, 75th Infantry in the Republic of Vietnam as a reconnaissance team member and was awarded the Air Medal after his first six months of deployment.  Following Vietnam, Ranger Murphy’s Ranger service and volunteer spirit continued for many years with service in B Company, Ranger, 75th Infantry and as a combat-seasoned Ranger serving as original cadre in the 1st Ranger Battalion, the first full Ranger Battalion since World War II, where he served two tours.  He was an original Squad Leader, creating and proving new concepts, training, and combat formations.  Ranger Murphy made immeasurable contributions in his role with the 1st Ranger Battalion in defining the roles and standards for team leader, squad leader, and platoon sergeant for Ranger generations to come.  His second tour with the 1st Ranger Battalion culminated with his participation in OPERATION EAGLE CLAW, for which his platoon was selected as the Ranger element for the operation.  Observing the need for helicopter pilots in this failed mission, Ranger Murphy volunteered for Rotary Flight School.  After 12 years and 10 months of service to the Infantry in predominately Ranger units, Murphy became a helicopter pilot.  In this role, he took Ranger excellence outside the Ranger community and served two tours in Germany during the Cold War.  He also served during the insurgency in El Salvador, a fitting mission for a battle-seasoned Ranger of Vietnam.  Ranger Murphy continued to make a difference in the Army, primarily as Pilot-in-Command and Flight Safety Officer for an additional 13 years and 7 months—proving time and again to be a tireless volunteer who led the way of his own accord, exemplifying the Ranger Regiment motto, SUA SPONTE!</citation>

After retiring as a Lieutenant General, Doctor Peake was nominated to become Secretary of Veteran’s Affairs.  During senate confirmation hearings, a distinguished senator noted that Doctor Peake’s service as an Infantry officer gave him a unique warrior’s perspective on how our wounded should be cared for.  President Bush stated at his swearing in ceremony on 20 December 2007 that “The secretary is charged with a solemn responsibility to ensure our Nation’s veterans receive the care and the benefits they deserve.  Doctor Jim Peake has the skills and experience to carry out this mission.  He is both the first physician and the first general officer to lead this department.”  Doctor Peake has aggressively seen to the treatment of our Soldiers and his actions exemplify the part of the Ranger Creed that states “I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy.”</citation>

He served in the Airborne Department at Fort Benning and in the elite Team 162, Red Hats, as an Advisor to the Vietnamese 7th Airborne Battalion.  He served a total of 10 years in the Ranger Department where he taught had-to-hand combat, demolitions, navigation, booby traps, survival, and a host of subjects pertaining to leading a patrol.  He was on the Ranger Hand-to-Hand combat team that demonstrated to President Kennedy at Fort Bragg.  His terminal Army assignment was as the original First Sergeant of Company B, 2/75th Ranger Battalion, Fort Lewis, WA.  Ranger Block has never stopped serving.  He served in the Security Department at the Medical Center, Columbus, GA and as a Contracting Officer, Fort Benning.  He serves in many organizations; three of them are Ranger Associations.  He has consistently served as an officer in several Ranger associations.  He is as originator of the Worldwide Army Rangers, Inc (WAR) and has been its Secretary/Treasurer since its beginning.

Ranger Block has been awarded five Bronze Stars, two for valor; three Vietnam Crosses of Gallantry, one with a Silver Star &amp; one with a Bronze Star – both for valor and one with the Palm (unit award), totaling four awards for valor.  One citation for valor, as a Platoon Sergeant, 501st Airborne, 101st Airborne Division states, “In the initial contact, two of the enemy were killed - - three of the friendly troops were wounded and lay directly in the line of fire.  SFC Block moved unprotected through the increased hostile fire, provided covering fire for the evacuation of the injured and personally carried one of the seriously wounded to safety.  Without regard for his own personally safety, he returned to the front firing his weapon until his unit was safe.” His quiet demeanor belies his tough and brave core.  His consistent bravery in combat, his exemplary career with extensive Ranger and Airborne assignments, and his dedication to serving his fellow man during his retirement is unequivocal proof that he is the epitome of the Ranger Creed.</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant General (Retired) Carmen J. Cavezza is widely recognized for his valorous active duty services as an Infantry unit combat leader, exemplary leadership as a senior commander of combat units, and his distinguished civilian career as a Civil Servant.  One citation for valor states, “During a six-hour battle, CPT Cavezza continually exposed himself to intense hostile automatic fire while leading his men and directing neutralizing artillery fire.  He led his company in an assault as the Viet Cong fire grew in intensity and was wounded three times in the stomach by machinegun fire.  Upon being offered first aid he declined and ordered the men to continue the assault. His actions inspired the men and they routed the numerically superior force.”  Ranger Cavezza, while serving in the US Army Personnel Center, was directly involved in the selection of lieutenants assigned to 1/75 Ranger Battalion when it was formed in 1974.  As Chief of Staff of the Infantry Center, when the 75th Ranger Regiment was activated, he ensured the unit was fully supported.  Later, as the Commanding General of the 7th Infantry Division, Carmen was involved in the planning and employment of the 75th Ranger Regiment during Operation JUST CAUSE in Panama.  
After his 33 year career which culminated in his assignment as the Commanding General of I Corps, he retired from the Army only to continue to lead as a Public Servant.  Carmen’s persuasive leadership and keen insight played a role in Columbus, GA hosting the softball competition of the 1996 Olympics.  He then accepted the challenging job as City Manager of Columbus, GA.  His Ranger ethos of excellence in all endeavors led to Columbus making significant improvements.  Most appropriately, he was then selected to be the Director of the Center of Leadership Development, Columbus State University.  His valorous leadership during combat at the Company and Battalion levels, his exemplary command at higher levels and his distinguished civilian service sets him far above most US Army Rangers and marks him truly as one who “never fails his comrades” and “shoulders his share of the task, one hundred per cent and then some.”  Ranger Cavezza is the epitome of exemplary valor, dedication, and excellence!</citation>

   <citation>Private First Class Raymond Noel Dye began his distinguished military service when he joined the Armored Forces at Fort Knox, KY on November 12, 1942. Upon arrival in Oran, North Africa, in April 1943, he answered Colonel Darby’s call for volunteers for the elite Ranger force, thinking that it would be less hazardous than serving in tanks in the open desert. He served with the 1st Ranger Battalion through the eve of the Sicily Invasion, when he was transferred to 4th Ranger Battalion. Ranger Dye performed his duties with distinction in combat through three invasions – Sicily, Salerno, and Anzio, Italy. He participated in a daring raid 12 miles behind German lines where his Ranger buddy, Charles Roby, was killed in action on November 4, 1943. At Chiunzi Pass, Ranger Dye was hand selected to join a British forward observer to pinpoint critical targets for naval gunfire that destroyed a key German Ammo Supply Depot, among other targets. Ranger Dye went AWOL from the hospital on two occasions to return to his Rangers to “shoulder more than his share of the task”. He was wounded a fourth and final time at Anzio. His awards and decorations include the Bronze Star, Purple Heart with 3 oak leaf clusters, Good Conduct Medal, European-Africa-Middle East Campaign Medal with Arrowhead, National Defense Service Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation and the Combat Infantry Badge. Throughout the hard fought campaigns of World War II, Ranger Dye set the example for others to follow and truly led the way.</citation>

He is selected as a Distinguished Member of the Ranger Training Brigade and also as a Distinguished Member of the 502nd Infantry Regiment.  Ranger Singletary was a Ranger Instructor for over seven years.  He served two combat tours in Vietnam, first as a Squad Leader, then Platoon Sergeant with A Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment.  During this tour, he received the Army Commendation Medal with Valor device and the Purple Heart.  He volunteered for a second tour as a Vietnamese Ranger Advisor and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor device and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm.  His first award for valor reads in part, “Directed to move forward and provide suppressive fire for a platoon pinned down by enemy fire, Sergeant Singletary immediately took the point and led his squad across open terrain towards the enemy positions.  Soon brought under intense machinegun and mortar fire, he sent one fire team to the left in an attempt to outflank the enemy.  When his maneuver element also became pinned down, he immediately secured an M-79 grenade launcher, dashed forward through the enemy fire, and began placing devastating grenade fire on the enemy positions.  Obtaining fire superiority through Sergeant Singletary’s heroic actions, his platoon was able to move forward and overrun the enemies’ positions.”  While serving as a Reconnaissance Company Advisor to ARVN 5th Ranger Group, one platoon of the Reconnaissance Company was assigned an ambush position in Can Giouc District, Long An Province.  At approximately 2200 hours the platoon began receiving extremely intense small arms, automatic weapons, and rocket fire.  Sergeant Singletary moved with the remainder of the Reconnaissance Company to reinforce the platoon.  He fiercely exposed himself to enemy fire as he moved among the assaulting Rangers directing their fire and inspiring them to assault vigorously.  Through his courageous actions, the Reconnaissance Company overran the enemy and inflicted numerous casualties on the Viet Cong.  Ranger Singletary continues to serve his community and is an active member of Ranger organizations.</citation>

   <citation>Major General Eldon Bargewell, United States Army, retired, has had an unparalleled impact on the Ranger community spanning four decades. As a young reconnaissance sergeant leading teams across the border into North Vietnam and Laos he was fearless under the most dangerous and complex conditions. He was wounded on four separate occasions and was awarded our nation’s second highest award for valor, the Distinguished Service Cross, for his gallantry in action. After graduation with honors from Ranger School and Officer Candidate School, he was handpicked to serve as a Ranger platoon leader in B Company (Ranger) Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols (LRRPS) and then the newly activated 2nd Ranger Battalion. During his 17 years in 1st Special Forces, Operational Detachment-Delta (SFOD-D), he was instrumental in integrating companies from the Ranger Battalions in training and exercise scenarios. After the Mogadishu Operation, he changed the Joint Special Operations Command exercise program and scenarios to force better integration and cooperation between the Ranger Battalions and 1st SFOD-D. The development of complimentary doctrine and tactics, techniques and procedures during this time, helped cement the concept that Special Operations Force units with different tactical focuses need to support each other directly on operations. This integration has produced tremendous results for contingency operations worldwide. Throughout his distinguished career, Ranger Bargewell was the absolute role model of authenticity, competency, and quiet professionalism for at least two generations of Rangers and special operations soldiers. His personal courage as a young Ranger NCO and over three decades as a special operations leader has brought true meaning to these words from the Ranger Creed: “Never shall I fail my comrades; gallantly will I show the world I am a specially selected and well-trained soldier; and I will never leave a fallen comrade”.</citation>

A master of doctrine, he wrote the manual used to train Pathfinders during the Vietnam War. His courtesy, communications skills, and image as a Soldier secured his appointment as the first Protocol Officer at West Point. He represented the Academy for official visitors, from citizen to chief of state. In Vietnam, he energetically met the enemies of his country, serving at the battalion and brigade levels as Executive Officer (XO) and Operations Officer (S-3) of infantry units in combat with the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong. He was the brigade S-3 in the defeat of the 2nd NVA Division’s assault on 3rd Brigade, 1st Calvary Division, inflicting such heavy casualties on the enemy that it was reduced to a minimal force in the Tet Offensive. During Tet, as S-3 at Hue, he executed attacks by infantry, artillery, air strikes and naval gunfire on a superior NVA force in fortified positions, inflicting such heavy losses that the NVA could not complete its mission. His brigade also led the relief of Khe Sanh, led the division assault into the A Shau Valley against strong resistance, and the assault into NVA Base area 114. For his actions, Ranger Bowman received awards including the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star with "V", the Bronze Star, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm.

His exemplary courage, his effective leadership in combat and as a civilian, and his book, Of Their Own Accord, sets the example for all. He was commissioned as an Infantry lieutenant at the United States Military Academy in 1969, and he retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army Reserve. For one year he served in combat in Vietnam as the Platoon Leader, 2nd Platoon, Charlie Rangers (Airborne). He spent hundreds of hours in an O-1 Birddog airplane as Command &amp; Control of inserted Long Range Patrol (LRP) Ambush Teams. While conducting a rotary wing air mobile operation one of Gary’s team leaders on the ground reported contact, one KIA, and that they were unable to recover the casualty. Ranger Dolan directed the pilot to the area where he saw smoke rise from the action in the triple canopy jungle, but there was no where to land. He asked the pilot to hover close to a tree so he could jump into it and go retrieve the dead warrior. He left his weapon, jumped into the tree, went down, retrieved the dead Soldier, joined the team and, with the Soldier on his back, led them to a landing site where all were extracted. Each month, Ranger Dolan joined one of the LRPs on combat operations. The company policy was, “No officers to get awards for valor,” Dolan included, even after many repeated requests from his men on behalf of their admired and highly respected leader. He has owned, led &amp; influenced many organizations: President, Company E, 20th Infantry &amp; Company C (Ranger), 75th Infantry (Airborne) Association, Inc, where he led a seven-year effort to enshrine the fallen members of the unit in the National Ranger Memorial, Special Operations Command Memorial, and the 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Memorial. He spearheaded the effort for placing engraved stones at the National Ranger Memorial for all USMA Rangers killed in action. Gary continues to serve his community in many ways: he is a practicing attorney, an accomplished business man, adjunct professor, and moderator of local Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder support meetings.

CSM England’s leadership and experience led him to be selected as a Command Sergeant Major at the Battalion, Brigade, Division, Corps level and of the Combined/Joint Task Force-180 in Afghanistan. CSM England continues to give one hundred percent and then some to Soldiers as the Deputy Director and Chief of Plans and Operations of the Directorate of Plans, Training, and Mobilization at Fort Bragg, NC, and numerous other organizations dedicated to the service and welfare of Soldiers and Veterans.</citation>

   <citation>First Sergeant Sean Thomas Kelly, United States Army, retired, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for 20 years of exceptionally meritorious service–most of which was with Ranger units –in both war and peace. 1SG Kelly has led Rangers from the front during airborne operations in two different combat zones, an accomplishment held by very few. His first time came as a squad leader in A Company, 1/75th Ranger Battalion during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada. Ranger Kelly earned his second Army Expeditionary Medal with Arrowhead device as well as his second Combat Jump Star when he led a platoon from A Company, 3/75th Ranger Battalion into Panama in support of Operation Just Cause. His career consisted of a growing number of accomplishments whereby he was continuously recognized and sought after for his outstanding leadership and training abilities. He was selected to conduct Platoon Confidence Training (PCT) in Germany, a position of great merit held exclusively by Rangers. While serving with HHC, 75th Ranger Regiment, Kelly was instrumental in the success of the Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP). He was also recognized for his service with the 11th Infantry Regiment for training the top Senior Noncommissioned Officers of a Company, an extremely demanding job. Ranger Kelly has also earned recognition for taking his expertise outside the Ranger / Special Operations communities and selflessly served local communities. When a request came to train law enforcement in the war against crime in Indiana, 1SG Kelly, selflessly took 45 days of personal leave to assist in a training program, resulting in multiple successful raids for drugs and firearms. Kelly’s additional assignments to train in Special Operations outside the Army include the Navy (SEALs), Air Force, and Civil Law Enforcement communities. His expertise in executing training programs made a significant difference in the Ranger Indoctrination Program, Ranger Re-entry Program, and the Ranger Training Brigade. He is a credit to the Great Ranger Legacy.</citation>

   <citation>Colonel Paul R. Longgrear, United States Army, retired, is inducted into the US Army Ranger Hall of Fame based upon his exemplary military &amp; religious leadership, valor during extreme combat, and his long, profound service to our nation. While commanding a Mobile Strike Force Company, 5th Special Forces, at Lang Vei, Vietnam, on February 6th and 7th, 1968, he destroyed two Russian Tanks with Light Anti-Armor Weapons when the post was overrun by a large enemy Armor, Infantry, and Sapper force. He led his unit in destroying nine other tanks, numerous enemy, and the defense of the command bunker for fifteen hours while being surrounded. After refusing several times the offer to surrender, with no food and water left and little ammunition, he concluded no relief forces were coming. Even though severely wounded, he led the breakout and escape by personally destroying a machinegun nest. Later, at a rendezvous point he again exposed himself to enemy fire while directing the incoming relief helicopters. While recovering from wounds he volunteered to command Basic Training Co E/1, 1st Brigade, Fort Benning for one year, during which time the company won Best Company during every cycle. Upon being released and cleared for full duty, he again volunteered for duty in Vietnam. He completed Ranger School and reported to command Co A, 5/46, Americal Division. During his command the company attained the highest kill ratio in the 198th Brigade. During the defense of a landing site, several enemy soldiers broke through the perimeter but due to CPT Longgrear’s leadership and expertise, his troops rallied and restored the security of the perimeter. For his actions throughout the war, Paul was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars for Valor, and a Purple Heart. At Florida Southern College, he initiated and then led Senior ROTC cadets through Ranger-type training in SCUBA, parachuting, and leadership. He trained elite ROTC students during Thanksgiving week break at Camp Merrill and another group during Spring break week at Camp Rudder. Paul was called into full-time Christian ministry in 1976. He served the next fourteen years in the Army Reserve while serving as a church pastor and completing three years in the missionary field. Ranger Longgrear’s valor under extreme combat and his consistent leadership and support of civilians, service members, and their families are truly exemplary.</citation>

   <citation>Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Wawrzyniak, United States Marine Corps, retired, is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in recognition of his heroism in combat, leading troops with distinction in every leadership position from rifle squad leader to Battalion commander. He participated in the historic Inchon Landing in Korea in September 1950 and on 19 September 1951 he was part of an assault against a strongly defended enemy hill top position. Although severely wounded by enemy fire, Wawrzyniak continued to lead the assault to accomplish the mission. For his actions that day he was awarded the Navy Cross and Purple Heart. On 16 April 1952, now Gunnery Sergeant Wawrzyniak and his company were attacked by vastly superior enemy forces causing part of his unit to be separated from the main body. In a desperate fire fight and again wounded, he rallied his troops and was able to rescue the separated unit and repel the attack. He was awarded his 2nd Navy Cross and 3rd Purple Heart for his actions. Commissioned a Lieutenant of Marines in 1953, Wawrzyniak was tasked with helping to set the mission for the new recon units of the Marine Corps. As part of that mission he trained Marines and Army troops in mountain warfare, cold weather combat, and survival. Assigned to Force Recon in 1961, 35 year old Capt Wawrzyniak successfully completed Airborne, Ranger and Navy dive courses taking top honors in each. He was the distinguished honor graduate of Ranger Class 2-62. As a Forward Area Battle Commander in Viet Nam, Ranger Wawrzyniak fought alongside legendary Ranger Hall of Fame member John W. Ripley twice being awarded the Bronze Star Medal with “V” device and a 4th Purple Heart. He lived that part of the Ranger Creed which states that “energetically will I meet the enemies of my country; I shall defeat them on the field of battle for I am better trained and will fight with all my might.” Rangers Lead the Way!

Ranger Jim Dubik embodied the Ranger in every position he held during his distinguished career. He truly
“never failed his comrades, kept himself mentally alert, physically strong, and morally straight, and always
shouldered more than his share of the task, whatever it may be, one-hundred-percent and then some”. He
was the absolute role model for intellect, tactical and training expertise, and professionalism for at least two
generations of Rangers and American Soldiers. He led Soldiers on three major operations in Haiti, Bosnia, and
Iraq as a senior leader. His vast training experience was brought to bear when he developed the total training
program for the first Stryker units and commanded the largest training mission in the world during Operation
Iraqi Freedom. His leadership was instrumental in accelerating the training of the Iraqi military and national
police during a critical stage of the war, resulting in the accelerated fielding and operational readiness of Iraqi
units, allowing the orderly withdrawal of US and Allied forces. Ranger Dubik’s lasting impact on our Armed
Forces and America’s Allies during his numerous General Officer commands was nurtured and shaped during
his company and field grade years in two Ranger Battalions. He was handpicked from among thousands of
Infantry lieutenants to serve in the newly activated 2d Ranger Battalion in 1974, and was the first officer
selected to command a Ranger company who had not yet attended the Captains Career Course. Ranger Dubik
lived the Ranger Creed throughout his career, and his induction into the Ranger Hall of Fame serves as a
lasting recognition of his lifetime commitment of service to our Nation and his profound contributions to
the training and readiness of Soldiers throughout the world. His rise from a young Ranger Lieutenant to a
Lieutenant General in command of the largest training mission in the 21st Century is an inspiration for others.

Sergeant Major for the United States Army Infantry Center and School, Fort Benning, GA. He culminated
a 30 year career as the Post Command Sergeant Major for Fort Benning, GA. CSM Klein’s illustrious career
allowed him to export his Ranger leadership skills outside the Ranger Community, a fulfillment of the vision
GEN Abrams had in creating the modern day Ranger Battalions, where outstanding leaders of Ranger quality
strengthened other units with the same integrity and strength so befitting Rangers. CSM Klein is an icon and
example to be emulated in the Modern Day Ranger Battalions and the United States Army.

Colonel Richard J. Malvesti is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his lifetime of achievement as a Ranger,
his enormous contributions to the Special Operations community, and for his outstanding performance as
a Soldier and American leader. Colonel Malvesti’s style of leadership consistently inspired confidence and
motivation in his men. Always leading from the front, Ranger Malvesti routinely provided sound command
guidance and insisted on strict compliance to rigid training standards, thus ensuring mission success on
numerous highly classified national contingency missions. During his initial assignment to Germany where
he served as a Recon Platoon Leader and Company Commander, his professionalism and vast potential were
recognized and rewarded when he was selected to serve as the battalion S3 as a First Lieutenant. Following
his combat tour to Vietnam as a District Senior Advisor, Colonel Malvesti was assigned as an Instructor at the
Florida Ranger camp for three years. His reputation as a leader was so legendary that years later the Ranger
Training Brigade named an obstacle course in his honor. After a tour with the 82nd Airborne Division as a
staff officer and company commander, Colonel Malvesti was selected as one of the original officers for the
newly formed 2nd Ranger Battalion at Fort Lewis where he served as the A Company Commander, and
battalion S4 and S3. After attending CGSC and attaining a Masters Degree, he was assigned to the 82nd
Airborne Division as the DISCOM S3 before being selected for 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-
Delta where he served in numerous key command and leadership positions from 1981 until 1989. In June
1989 he was selected to be the Director of Operations for the Joint Special Operations Command where he
was the principal architect for the operational plans for Operation Just Cause in Panama and the initial JSOC
special operations supporting plans for Operation Desert Storm. On the 4th of July, 1990, COL Malvesti was
tragically killed during a parachuting accident at Holland DZ, Fort Bragg, NC. His awards and decorations
include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal; the Bronze Star with “V” device with one oak leaf cluster, the
MSM with oak leaf cluster; the Joint Service Commendation Medal; the Army Commendation Medal with
oak leaf cluster; the CIB; EIB; Master Parachutist Badge, Pathfinder Badge; and the Ranger and Special Forces

1SG Frank Mattivi is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for outstanding leadership and service in both
his military and civilian careers. Mattivi was one of the original first 500 Rangers hand-picked by COL Darby
himself to train and serve in the first Ranger Battalion in our great nation’s history. 1SG Mattivi enlisted
with the 34th Red Bull Division, and was one of the first American troops to deploy to the European theater
where he later volunteered to be a Ranger. As a member of the 1st Ranger Battalion during World War II,
he participated in five campaigns: Algeria-French Morocco, Tunisia, Sicily, Naples-Foggia, and Anzio. 1SG
Mattivi demonstrated extreme dedication to his Ranger Brothers on the front lines when he was wounded
in the leg by shrapnel during the battle for the heights above Ceppagna and Venafro, Italy. He refused to be
evacuated to the hospital, fearing he would not be returned to his Ranger unit. Ranger Mattivi demonstrated
this to yet another extreme when he and approximately 535 Rangers of the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions were
captured on 30 January 1944 during the Battle at Cisterna. It was during this battle that Ranger Mattivi, after
many prior campaigns of great accomplishment, made his greatest of all. Ranger Mattivi identified a German
tank traversing its turret to strike a building he knew to be occupied by many Rangers. He bravely jumped
onto the rear of the German tank, opened the hatch, and dropped a phosphorous grenade inside with complete
disregard for his own safety. His heroic actions just prior to his capture saved the lives of many fellow Rangers
taking cover inside the building. Following his capture, Ranger Mattivi spent nearly 18 months in a Stalag
POW camp before he was repatriated and returned to the states where he served time in the Army Reserves
before reentering civilian life. His dedicated service and physical bravery epitomizes the Ranger Creed.

RGR Bacerra is inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in recognition of his heroism in combat, outstanding accomplishments, and strong leadership abilities.  He began his distinguished military career in April 1946.  He served with the 11th Airborne Division in Japan during the occupation of Japan after World War II.  He completed Airborne and Glider Training during this assignment.  Additional overseas tours included Korea, Germany, Iran, and Vietnam.  As the Battalion Sergeant Major of the 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, and a highly trained Ranger, his leadership skills became evident while accompanying a platoon search and destroy mission.  He received the Bronze Star Medal for Valor which reads "while accompanying a platoon on search and destroy mission, the platoon was soon pinned down.  Ranger Bacerra detecting the sniper's probable location, without hesitation rounded the platoon's right flank drawing rapid fire and moved quickly to a position to the rear of the sniper's location.  When the sniper attempted to withdraw, Ranger Bacerra engaged and killed him in an individual firefight."  Ranger Bacerra's disregard for his own personal safety was an inspiration to the members of the platoon.  RGR Bacerra participated in every combat assault the battalion conducted during his assignment.  He demonstrated physical and mental toughness during long periods in the field while accompanying teams on Long Range Reconnaissance and combat patrols.  One night, RGR Bacerra informed his Battalion Commander at 2300 hours that he was making the midnight insertion with the HAWK Team.  His Commander replied, "Sergeant Major, you're going to get your ass killed!"  To which RGR Bacerra replied "Yes Sir," saluted and made the insertion.  RGR Bacerra is the epitome of a Ranger Noncommissioned Officer and was a role model of the Ranger Noncommissioned Officer Gen Abrams envisioned when creating the modern day Ranger Battalions.
